41171875,One SQ HEDGES DNA vector only dose produces durable hGLA or anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb therapeutic serum protein levels.,2025,"It is estimated that ~2 billion people worldwide cannot afford even basic medicines. Bioreactor-produced recombinant protein therapies (BRPTs), among the world's most-expensive medicines, have revolutionized treatment of a wide-spectrum of human-diseases, particularly the ~ 7,000 incurable, rare human single-protein, monogenic-deficiency diseases. Currently, BRPT are limited by toxicity, immunogenicity, short protein T1/2s and high-cost, creating a worldwide access-gap between those who can afford BRPTs versus those who cannot. Fabry disease (FD) is a monogenic deficiency disease caused by pathogenic-variants of the galactosidase-a (GLA) gene. FD damages heart, kidneys, CNS, gastrointestinal tract, and eyes. State-of-the-art anti-FD therapy, hGLA enzyme-replacement-therapy (ERT), requires bi-weekly IV infusions lifelong, costing ~ $200,000 per-patient per-year. High-lifetime costs can cause significant numbers of FD patients to permanently discontinue hGLA-ERT, thereby accelerating FD progression, which can lead to premature-death. Subcutaneously administered plasmid DNA alone has not been previously reported to transfect subcutaneous fat. Here we show one Subcutaneous Administration of HEDGES DNA vectors Alone (SAHDA) encoding the wildtype hGLA protein safely produces durable hGLA serum protein levels in the 1-10 ng/mL normal human hGLA range in immunocompetent mice. Unexpectedly, one administration of a highly-optimized SAHDA version encoding hGLA produced durable, ~ 100-fold higher hGLA serum protein levels than the 10 ng/mL high-normal human level. Importantly, components of the SADHA platform can be simply-modified to control the level and duration of hGLA serum protein-levels produced over a broad temporal-range in mice. Furthermore, one SAHDA-based administration of a HEDGES DNA-vector encoding a highly-neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) safely produces long-term protective serum mAb levels in immunocompetent-mice. SAHDA offers multiple advantages over BRPT, including not requiring an intact cold-chain and being readily freeze-dried. This combination enables SAHDA's rapid deployment, then prolonged storage at ambient temperatures, even in equatorial-areas worldwide. SAHDA can readily be self-administered worldwide. It also obviates severe intravenous-infusion reactions. Taken-together, SAHDA may more effectively-, safely-, durably-, and cost-effectively-treat a spectrum of now poorly-treatable diseases worldwide.",0.33898346935612356,0.33898346935612356,0.0,0.0,0.5676095528911081,0.5676095528911081,0.16257313331074386,0.16257313331074386,0.3677176186229938,0.34419104412673895,0.40221113078728593,0.4761115399213019,0.4206862330707899,1
41171473,Lateral flow immunoassay based on large-sized Au@Ag nanoparticles for stable colorimetric enhanced detection of D-dimer.,2025,"The Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) has been widely used in environmental monitoring and disease diagnosis due to its advantages of low cost, simple operation, and convenience. However, its accuracy and sensitivity remain major challenges to be addressed. D-dimer is an important biomarker for thrombotic diseases. In this work, we show for the first time a core-shell Au@Ag nanoparticle (NP) labeled colorimetrically enhanced LFIA for D-dimer detection. The superior performance of Au@Ag LFIA stems from the silver shell's enhancement of plasmon resonance, which boosts optical signals to yield brighter scattering and superior visual contrast. Compared with conventional AuNPs, Au@AgNPs significantly improve sensitivity, leading to more accurate results. The detection limit for D-dimer was improved by approximately tenfold, reaching 1 ng/mL, due to the improved cross-coupling efficiency of Au@AgNPs compared with AuNPs. We anticipate that, with further development and validation, this enhanced LFIA could become a valuable tool in a wide range of clinical diagnostic applications.",0.3790439819490515,0.3790439819490515,0.09451613352693214,0.09451613352693214,0.41917776041969634,0.41917776041969634,0.33526116470694095,0.33526116470694095,0.4177047361910512,0.30300530874839354,0.3894386428019687,0.4410898526760749,0.40235144527049527,1
41169649,Disentangling informing participants from obtaining their consent.,2025,"Pragmatic clinical trials conducted in the context of routine care frequently satisfy the regulatory criteria for a waiver of research consent. When they do, investigators and Institutional Review Boards might assume that there is no reason to communicate any information regarding the study to participants. Yet, this approach ignores the possibility that there may be value in providing information to participants, even when the study does not pose significant risks and researchers are not obtaining their consent. Members of the NIH Collaboratory Ethics and Regulatory Core working group used ethical analysis to determine whether there are reasons to provide information to research participants, other than notifying them of significant risks or obtaining their consent. Study team members then provided examples of trials which illustrate the feasibility and different options for providing information to participants in the context of trials conducted with a waiver of research consent. Communicating information to participants can promote one or more of six goals: respect for persons, participant understanding of the research, participant understanding of their contributions, participant ability to voice any concerns, participant engagement, and trust and trustworthiness. Providing information can also raise potential concerns about feasibility and cost, which need to be balanced against these reasons to inform participants. Depending on the study, a variety of methods can be used to communicate information; for example, letters, email, flyers, posters, as well as brief conversations with clinicians. Even when researchers are not obtaining participants' consent, communicating information can promote one or more of six important goals. Providing information to participants should thus be the default for trials conducted under a waiver of research consent.",0.7611843680867548,0.7611843680867548,0.5448109066010366,0.5448109066010366,0.3890090298355978,0.3890090298355978,0.20409402409958227,0.20409402409958227,0.504667663193223,0.4257957241231283,0.5359221333043652,0.2916808455428735,0.4748618113639923,1
41165433,A pilot point-of-care kidney disease clinic in primary care to pharmacologically optimise people with chronic kidney disease (PROTECT KIDNEY).,2025,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing in prevalence and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Early initiation of cardiorenal protective medications is recommended to improve outcomes. Barriers to implementation include renal function monitoring and resources to initiate and titrate treatment. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a protocolled point-of-care testing (POCT) pathway to optimise people living with proteinuric CKD in primary care. A pilot quality improvement study conducted across three general practices in Greater London, United Kingdom. Inclusion criteria were adults (18-80 years) with hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, proteinuria, and reduced kidney function (eGFR 30-75 ml/min/1.73m2), who were identified using electronic health records. POCT for creatinine and potassium enabled real-time decision-making using a traffic light clinical decision support system. The primary outcome was recruitment rate and patient acceptability. Secondary efficacy outcomes included medication optimisation and renal function changes. Twenty-five (52%) of 48 patients agreed to participate. Overall, 23/25 (92%) completed the pathway and 20/25 (80%) achieved pharmacological optimisation. There were no significant adverse events. POCT was successful in 44/57 (77%) of cases and well tolerated by most participants (10/13; 77%). Patient satisfaction was high (12/13; 92%), with most preferring advanced nurse practitioners or pharmacists in future clinics. A POCT-led CKD optimisation pathway is feasible and well-accepted in primary care. While high medication optimisation rates were achieved, barriers to recruitment and engagement remain. Future studies should evaluate scalability, long-term clinical impact, and cost-effectiveness to inform wider implementation.",0.40274713256404654,0.40274713256404654,0.34117637446558763,0.34117637446558763,0.5044587200574544,0.5044587200574544,0.4566971606150315,0.4566971606150315,0.8263184745503925,0.759500941032384,0.5064630160765238,0.671948645815504,0.5478344235112689,1
41164067,Economic Burden and Clinical Epidemiology of Dialysis: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Chronic Kidney Disease Patients.,2025,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a rising global health burden, with millions requiring dialysis as a form of kidney replacement therapy. In low- and middle-income countries such as Pakistan, dialysis care is partially subsidised, but patients often face substantial out-of-pocket (OOP) costs, creating financial strain. This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted at a dialysis unit of a secondary care hospital in Pakistan. All patients on maintenance hemodialysis were invited to participate; the response rate was 80.8%. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and review of medical records. Demographic, clinical, and economic variables were captured, including comorbidities, dialysis duration and frequency, use of supportive therapies, and direct, indirect medical and non-medical costs in 2024 US dollars (USD). Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The cohort comprised 42 patients, 66.7% of whom were male (n = 28), with a mean CKD duration of 6.8 ± 5.2 years and a median dialysis duration of 1.0 year (IQR, 0.6-2.0 years). The mean age of the cohort was 58.3 ± 13.7 years (range, 25-83 years). Most (95.2%) were on twice-weekly hemodialysis. Despite full coverage of dialysis sessions through the Sehat Sahulat Programme, all patients incurred recurrent OOP costs. The median monthly ""basic bundle"" (consultation, labs, medications) cost was Pakistani rupees (PKR) 22,100 (approximately USD $78.40), equivalent to a mean annual cost of PKR 316,057 ± 149,030 (USD $1,121.55 ± $528.92). Additional costs included erythropoietin (85.7%, median PKR 7,600/month), blood transfusions (42.9%, median PKR 12,000/year), hospitalisations (38.1%, median PKR 190,000/year), transport (median PKR 4,800/month), and special diet (57.1%, median PKR 10,000/month). Using cumulative burden thresholds, 28.6% of households exceeded 100% of their monthly household income for expanded costs (4.8% for basic costs). Dialysis patients in Pakistan carry a heavy dual burden of disease and economic hardship. While sessional dialysis is publicly financed, significant ancillary costs remain, often exceeding household income and driving catastrophic health spending. Policies expanding financial protection to include medications, laboratory testing, nutrition, and transport are urgently needed.",0.24654312009301987,0.24654312009301987,0.13374782166477928,0.13374782166477928,0.8150356613325558,0.8150356613325558,0.8950811224146685,0.8950811224146685,0.8490203899240416,0.7761451290680181,0.5933665878518483,0.6624305126456834,0.610632569050307,1
41162779,"Kidney transplantation in Africa: a systematic review of treatment outcomes, and strategies for enhancing care and sustainability.",2025,"Kidney transplantation remains the most effective treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), yet its application and outcomes across Africa are poorly consolidated. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated treatment outcomes of kidney transplantation in African countries, identifying challenges and strategies to enhance sustainability. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, African Journals Online (AJOL), and African Index Medicus databases for relevant literature published between 2010 and 2025. A protocol was registered on PROSPERO with CRD420251112690. A total of 24 studies from various African regions were systematically reviewed, including prospective, retrospective, observational, and cross-sectional designs. Data were extracted on study characteristics, transplant details, immunosuppressive protocols, clinical outcomes, and reported challenges. The included studies encompassed 27 to 6,187 participants, spanning both adult (28.5 to 49 years) and pediatric (8.9 to 10.3 years) populations. Most transplants were performed using living donors, primarily first-degree relatives. Common immunosuppressants included tacrolimus, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, and prednisolone. Graft and patient survival rates were generally favorable and often comparable to global benchmarks, with some studies reporting survival rates at 1, 5, and 10 years. Kidney transplant outcomes across sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated strong survival rates despite limited resources. One-year patient survival reached 90.7% in Nigeria, 91.2% in Tanzania, 90.4% in South Africa, 92.3% in Ethiopia, and 98.4% in Egypt. Living donor transplants consistently outperformed deceased donor cases, with one-year graft survival rates of 87% in Nigeria and 96.7% in Tanzania. HIV-positive to HIV-positive programs achieved 84% survival at both 1 and 3 years. Immunological challenges remain, with acute rejection rates ranging from 8% to 43.4%. Delayed graft function and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches significantly predicted poorer outcomes. New-onset diabetes, more common with tacrolimus, affected up to 36% of recipients. Chronic dysfunction and metabolic complications were also prevalent, particularly in long-term follow-up. Predictors of poor outcomes included older age, diabetes, female sex, and delayed graft function. Key challenges reported included high cost, with up to 98% of patients discontinuing dialysis within 12 weeks due to affordability; limited infrastructure such as tissue typing facilities and reliance on external support; insufficient access to modern immunosuppressants; weak follow-up systems with loss to follow-up rates as high as 20.9%; and ethical concerns regarding donor policies with donor consent rates as low as 26.3%. Kidney transplantation in Africa shows promising outcomes despite systemic barriers. Addressing infrastructural gaps, improving access to immunosuppressive therapy, and strengthening national transplant programs are critical for sustainable kidney care on the continent.",0.3933894610001735,0.3933894610001735,0.37974252115877744,0.37974252115877744,0.5534062725390395,0.5534062725390395,0.8378988044916935,0.8378988044916935,0.656362644887042,0.6687954171252783,0.549731069354379,0.6779179827654123,0.5817777977071372,1
41158496,Exploring reduced pulmonary exacerbation rates in cystic fibrosis: a pandemic or modulator effect?,2025,"The impact of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) on pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) in cystic fibrosis (CF) is difficult to estimate since ETI availability coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. Later access to ETI in Canada created a natural experiment to adjust for the impact of the pandemic on PEx rates. The objective for this study was to compare PEx rates pre- and post-ETI in the USA using Canada as a control group. This retrospective cohort study utilised data from the US and Canadian CF patient registries from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2022. Individuals with at least one F508del mutation and ≥12 years old were followed. Poisson regression was used to estimate PEx rates per 100 person-years of follow-up. A difference-in-difference approach was used to estimate the impact of ETI alone. Longitudinal data from 22 590 US individuals and 3271 Canadians were analysed. Pre-pandemic, the PEx rate was significantly higher in the USA (70.6, 95% CI 70.1-71.2) compared to Canada (53.1, 95% CI 51.9-54.3). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the PEx rate decreased to 30.2 (95% CI 28.8-31.8) in Canada; whereas in the USA, the rates decreased to 14.7 (95% CI 14.3-15.1). After adjusting for covariates, the ETI effect was 2.48 times (95% percentile interval 2.26-2.70) that of the pandemic effect. Public health measures imposed during the pandemic resulted in a reduction in the number of PEx for both countries; however, the impact of ETI on reducing the rate of PEx was more than double the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.",0.4308798739711381,0.4308798739711381,0.046349470145684045,0.046349470145684045,0.34929746115159643,0.34929746115159643,0.15434789584856345,0.15434789584856345,0.35542201451863287,0.16944498400700245,0.3478311601201067,0.3311718627927955,0.3436663357882789,1

This study aims to assess owner perspectives on the use of transdermal mirtazapine in cats. A multicentric survey-based study was conducted. A survey of 15 questions about efficacy, side effects, and overall perception was sent to owners of cats that had received the treatment between January 2021 and March 2023 in two European veterinary hospitals. From 108 contacted owners, 70 responses were obtained. Application to the ear was considered easy by 97% of respondents, and 91% followed the manufacturers' instructions for alternating ears. Side effects were reported by 20%, most often increased vocalization, redness, or restlessness. Chronic kidney disease was the most common reason for prescription. Nine owners had previously used the oral form, and most of them found the transdermal option easier, although some preferred the oral version due to lower cost. Overall, 77% of owners considered the treatment effective in stimulating appetite. Regarding length of therapy, about half administered it for less than 14 days, while the rest followed the labeled duration, with longer use associated with more consistent appetite improvement. These findings highlight that transdermal mirtazapine is generally well accepted by owners, easy to administer, and effective in promoting appetite in cats.",0.3847638913992902,0.3847638913992902,0.10028798772965447,0.10028798772965447,0.2217442950365164,0.2217442950365164,0.0,0.0,0.1295591429608404,0.10159903336064156,0.26462637827160734,0.10919050525303554,0.22576741001696438,1
41148389,Inequities Across the Spectrum of Osteoporosis Care and Post-Fracture Management in Men.,2025,"Sex specific differences in the determinants, occurrence, and distribution of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures play a pivotal role in the implementation of timely surveillance, prevention and effective treatment approaches. This review is aimed at synthesizing recently published scientific evidence on disparities in the epidemiology and management of osteoporosis and related fragility fractures in men. Several studies have identified race-, sex-, geographic-, socioeconomic-, and comorbidity-based disparities in osteoporosis care. Over the last decade, the awareness and imperative for identifying osteoporosis in men have increased. Nonetheless, the treatment gap is increasing and osteoporosis in men remains severely underappreciated and undertreated. Fewer studies in men have focused on the factors beyond osteoporosis awareness. Recent data of individuals aged 50 years and older show an alarmingly greater increase in hip fractures in men compared to women. This coupled with the existing knowledge of greater disability burden and excess mortality due to fragility fractures in men is a cause of public health concern. This review offers a comprehensive examination of widespread and profound disparities across the spectrum of osteoporosis care and post-fracture management in men and highlights the considerable health economic aspect of this burden. We call for targeted multifaceted interventions: develop novel methods to engage patients and health professionals, increase screening and treatment of osteoporosis in men, conduct epidemiological studies focused on disease phenotyping and risk factor assessment, studies on the identification of perceptions and barriers to effective screening and treatment, expansion and further evaluation of cost-effective therapies and primary prevention strategies for fractures, implementation of fracture liaison services to address the treatment gap in secondary prevention, and promote inclusivity in outcome studies and therapeutic trials.

41146923,"Prevalence, determinants, and prognostic impact of polyvascular disease in patients hospitalised for atherosclerosis in Slovenia: a nationwide, retrospective cohort study.",2025,"Polyvascular disease (PVD) is an increasingly recognised form of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with heightened prognostic implications. This study aimed to comprehensively assess the prevalence, risk factors, and prognosis of PVD in Slovenia. We conducted an observational retrospective cohort study using national-level reimbursement data from The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2023. The study considered all adults who were hospitalised for coronary, cerebrovascular, or lower extremity peripheral arterial disease with diagnoses defined using ICD-10 codes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify cardiovascular risk factors for PVD. Patients were grouped by the number of affected vascular beds. The primary outcomes were all-cause death, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major adverse limb events (MALE), and major bleeding. In outcome analysis, a landmark of 90 days was considered. Cause-specific survival analysis was performed, and associations with the primary outcomes was assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and prescribed medication. The study included 91,917 adults hospitalised for ASCVD. Of these, 85,703 (93.2%) had atherosclerosis in one vascular bed, 5878 (6.4%) in two, and 336 (0.4%) in three; the latter two groups (6214; 6.8%) were classified as having PVD. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors were strongly associated with PVD, with chronic kidney disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.96; 95% CI 1.81-2.11; p < 0.0001), diabetes (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.48-1.66; p < 0.0001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - a surrogate indicator of tobacco use (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.40-1.74; p < 0.0001) emerging as the strongest predictors. Compared to patients with ASCVD in one vascular bed, patients with two affected beds had adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.24 (95% CI 1.09-1.42) for all-cause death, 1.51 (95% CI 1.24-1.83) for MACE, 2.52 (95% CI 2.08-3.05) for MALE, and 1.27 (95% CI 1.05-1.54) for major bleeding. Patients with three affected beds had adjusted HRs of 1.69 (95% CI 1.40-2.03), 2.70 (95% CI 2.23-3.28), 4.24 (95% CI 3.49-5.14), and 2.31 (95% CI 1.45-3.68), respectively. Patients with PVD face a high overall disease burden, with adverse event rates increasing in proportion to the number of affected vascular beds. Accurate assessment of individual risk profiles is essential, as patients with the highest baseline risk are most likely to benefit from intensified preventive strategies. Potential underreporting inherent in administrative claims data, along with our selective criteria for defining leading diagnoses, may have somewhat limited the number of identified patients with PVD. Nonetheless, even after adjusting for group size, comorbidities, and prescribed medication, PVD independently predicted not only all-cause death and ischaemic events but also major bleeding. Further research is needed to define optimal treatment strategies in this high-risk population.

41134503,Urinary Tract Infection After Kidney Transplantation: Some Centers are Doing Better Than Others.,2025,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection after kidney transplantation and a source of significant morbidity and cost. The extent to which UTI rates vary across transplant centers remains unclear. We analyzed kidney transplant recipients with operation dates 3/2017-7/2020 in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) Transplant beta phase pilot database. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with 30-day UTI. A hierarchical logistic model was used to assess center outlier status. A total of 5128 kidney recipients at 25 transplant centers were included. Overall, 30-day UTI incidence was 6.1% (n = 312). Variation existed between centers (range: 0%-12.9%) in unadjusted analyses with five centers identified as outliers. Ureteral stent use (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.45-3.75, p < 0.01), longer urinary catheter duration (OR 1.03 per day, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, p < 0.01), female gender (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.76-2.84, p < 0.01) and recipient age (OR 1.01 per year, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p < 0.01) were all independently associated with higher UTI risk. These variables were found to explain 17% of the variation in UTI rate among centers. After adjustment, three centers were still identified as outliers. Early UTI incidence varies widely across United States transplant centers. Established risk factors explain some but not all the center variation. Future collaboration and comparison of practices across centers would help to reduce post-transplant complications such as UTIs.",0.17674455545874382,0.17674455545874382,0.0,0.0,0.4314392949360287,0.4314392949360287,0.7824978999384565,0.7824978999384565,0.48951333395496777,0.39154511105086814,0.37632983210937065,0.46491903667403334,0.39847713325053635,1
41126218,Identifying clusters of healthcare expenditure trajectories in end-stage organ disease: a retrospective cohort study using linked administrative databases in Singapore.,2025,"We aimed to identify subgroups of decedents with end-stage organ disease based on their healthcare expenditure trajectories over the final five years of life, and factors associated with incurring high costs in this period. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who died between 2017 and 2019, who had either a primary or secondary diagnosis of advanced dementia, severe liver disease, as well as heart, kidney or respiratory failure in the last five years of their lives. Data was extracted from administrative databases of a regional health system in Singapore. We classified patients into subgroups with distinctly different five-year healthcare expenditure trajectories, using longitudinal k-means clustering. Factors associated with membership in each subgroup were then identified through multinomial modelling. Among 7,154 decedents, three trajectories of consistently low cost (LC, n = 5,756), moderately high cost near death (MC, n = 1,283) and escalating cost near death (EC, n = 115) were identified. Patients with MC often had concurrent end-stage organ diseases and chronic conditions, while patients with EC were younger and often had respiratory failure. Across all subgroups, most patients had at least one emergency department attendance in their final three months and either late or no access to palliative care. Accounting for socio-demographic characteristics and comorbidity, patients with respiratory failure were more likely to have a high-cost trajectory. Our findings highlight the significance of upstream interventions to address needs of multi-morbid older adults, and pertinence of timely palliative care access to mitigate the use of aggressive care at the end-of-life.",0.32767485773698507,0.32767485773698507,0.12081496423637927,0.12081496423637927,0.4838845256868726,0.4838845256868726,0.648642928828895,0.648642928828895,0.5036016570931307,0.4921108098856721,0.4443934539669685,0.43101503099979965,0.4410488482251763,1
41125276,"Implementing a Scalable, personalised, behaviour Change digitAL hEalth programme in primary care for type 2 diabetes treatment: the SCALE cluster-randomised study protocol.",2025,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a fast-growing chronic disease, with at least 1.3 million people diagnosed in Australia. In the Western Sydney Local Health District (WSLHD), an estimated 13.1% of all adults have T2DM. The condition significantly contributes to cardiovascular, heart and kidney diseases and causes a large disease burden. Lifestyle modifications, such as improved nutrition, increased physical activity and stress reduction, are recommended as first-line treatments for T2DM management. However, the current primary care system cannot meet the growing demands for diabetes care, necessitating the development of innovative, scalable, cost-effective solutions. Digital health technologies present a promising approach for promoting self-management in individuals with T2DM. This cluster-randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of Gro-AUS, a localised version of the Gro Health app in Australia, to support T2DM management in Australian primary care settings. The trial will be conducted across multiple general practice clinics within the WSLHD, an area with a high prevalence of T2DM and significant cultural diversity in patient populations. Participants will be randomly assigned by clinic to either the intervention group (digital health programme) or control group (standard care). Primary outcomes include improvements in glycaemic control, cardiovascular risk factors and diabetes remission, with secondary outcomes such as weight loss, physical activity and mental well-being. Data will be collected using electronic and paper methods, with secure storage and de-identification ensuring participant privacy. The study's mixed-method approach ensures inclusivity for patients with varying levels of digital literacy. Data will be securely stored, de-identified and used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Findings are expected to inform future models of diabetes care in Australia, providing evidence for the scalability of digital health technologies in chronic disease management. This trial is by nature unblinded. The recruitment style for a stepped-wedge trial may also bias participant engagement. However, it has direct implications for clinical practice as an effectiveness implementation trial. The design also allows for a much larger sample and more statistical power to examine outcomes. This trial has been prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. Ethical approval has been granted by the WSLHD Human Research Ethics Committee prior to data collection.

An epidemiologic and descriptive study. We retrieved the data during the month of September 2023. Two independent researchers accessed the indicators in the Global Burden of Disease database: (i) number of cases and (ii) mortality from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, kidney diseases, and neoplasms, and (iii) level of physical activity in Brazilian individuals for the year 2019. Data were extracted by two researchers independently for the states of Brazil, stratified by sex (male and female), age groups (15-49 years, 50-69 years, and 70 or more years), cause of death and corresponding mortality (cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and kidney diseases, and neoplasms) and classified by regions according to geographic and administrative distribution in North, Northeast, Southeast, South, and Central-West. The number of deaths, age-standardized mortality, and years of life lost due to the disease were extracted, gross and in rates per 100,000 inhabitants. Mortality from noncommunicable diseases associated with low levels of physical activity in Brazil in 2019 was 293.39 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, highest in Maranhão, with 407.98 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, and lowest in the Distrito Federal and Minas Gerais, respectively.

41123392,Conductometric Biosensor for Quick Detection of Urinary Biomarkers in Chronic Kidney Disease Management.,2025,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a noncommunicable disease that brings long-term morbidity among people and is identified as a hidden epidemic. As the disease-causing pathophysiology process is different and complex for various diseases of CKD, specific biomarkers in urine should be monitored in aiding therapy and management of CKD. β-2 Microglobulin (β2MG), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and CD163 are three of such common biomarkers used in CKD management. Though different detection methods such as electrochemical sensors, electrochemiluminescence, and sandwich ELISA have been reported for these three biomarkers, they are associated with shortcomings such as complex device fabrication, longer detection time, and poor sensitivity. To overcome these disadvantages, the current study introduces high-resistivity-silicon (HR-Si)-based conductometric biosensors for rapid and sensitive detection of these three biomarkers. These conductometric biosensors successfully detected β2MG, EGF, and CD163 in urine with detection limits of 100 fM, 5 pM, and 10 fM, respectively. Other advantages of conductometric biosensors include relatively simple sensor fabrication, which is also low-cost, short sample incubation time (<15 min), fast detection time (<2 min), high selectivity, and the capability of miniaturization and compatibility with common electronics circuitry (ability to use as a portable device). These key features of the conductometric biosensors hold as a futuristic point-of-need tool in aiding CKD management and therapy.",0.15142299285231792,0.15142299285231792,0.10028798772965447,0.10028798772965447,0.4872797411101514,0.4872797411101514,0.5054605525527766,0.5054605525527766,0.5513645734934713,0.5840838877667344,0.38332208433550174,0.582740446466951,0.43317667486836403,1
41122597,Impact of Sodium Bicarbonate Supplementation on Kidney Function and Acid-Base Balance in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients: A Systematic Review.,2025,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health burden, with metabolic acidosis being a common complication that accelerates disease progression and contributes to muscle wasting, bone demineralization, and systemic inflammation. Sodium bicarbonate (SB) supplementation is widely used to correct acidosis, but its effects on kidney function and clinical outcomes remain inconsistent. This systematic review evaluates the impact of SB on kidney function, acid-base balance, and secondary outcomes in patients with CKD. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library up to May 2025. Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,354 patients were included. Studies assessed the effects of SB on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum bicarbonate, muscle mass, blood pressure, and adverse events. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool. SB supplementation consistently improved serum bicarbonate levels across all included studies, with statistically significant increases reported. The impact on kidney function, however, was variable, with some trials demonstrating improved eGFR while others showed no significant benefit. Positive effects on muscle mass preservation were observed in several studies, though physical function and blood pressure outcomes remained inconsistent. The intervention was generally well-tolerated, though gastrointestinal-related adverse events were more frequent with bicarbonate therapy compared to controls. Methodological quality was strong overall, with most studies demonstrating low risk of bias. SB effectively corrects metabolic acidosis in CKD but demonstrates variable effects on kidney function and secondary outcomes. Benefits appear most pronounced in early-to-moderate CKD, while patients with advanced disease may derive limited renal protection. Clinicians should individualize therapy, balancing biochemical correction with tolerability and cost. Future research should prioritize long-term trials with standardized outcomes to clarify the role of SB in CKD management.",0.2265317913784954,0.2265317913784954,0.08475980573479255,0.08475980573479255,0.2436753708129609,0.2436753708129609,0.50957652780785,0.50957652780785,0.4058584839879617,0.4111433382704088,0.30352964166526775,0.45042070339822227,0.34025240709850635,1
41122313,A cost-effectiveness comparison between immunotherapy combination regimens and sunitinib for advanced renal cell carcinoma in the USA and China.,2025,"Immunotherapy combinations like Pembrolizumab + Axitinib and Nivolumab + Ipilimumab have survival benefits over Sunitinib in advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) first-line treatment. But their cost-effectiveness in the USA and China is unclear. To assess the cost-effectiveness of three first-line treatment regimens for untreated aRCC-Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab, Pembrolizumab plus Axitinib, and Sunitinib-from the perspective of national health service systems and indirect healthcare payers in China and the USA, with a focus on intent-to-treat (ITT) populations and International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk stratifications. Decision-tree and Markov models, based on KEYNOTE-426 and CheckMate 214 trials, simulated 5-year disease progression of eligible patients. The model, constructed using TreeAge Pro 2022 (TreeAge Software, LLC, Williamstown, Massachusetts, USA), incorporated three health states: progression-free survival, progressive disease, and death. Economic parameters included direct medical costs (first-line and second-line treatments, adverse event management, monitoring), quality-adjusted life year (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate model uncertainty. Across favorable-risk, intermediate/poor-risk IMDC subgroups, and the ITT population, Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab sequential Cabozantinib demonstrated the optimal cost-effectiveness in both countries, with ICERs below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. It was associated with lower costs and higher QALYs compared to the other two regimens. Pembrolizumab plus Axitinib sequential Cabozantinib was more cost-effective than sunitinib sequential Cabozantinib in both regions, with ICERs also below WTP thresholds. In China and the USA, Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab is the most cost-effective first-line treatment for aRCC across different IMDC subgroups and the ITT population, followed by Pembrolizumab plus Axitinib, which outperforms sunitinib. These findings can guide clinical decision-making, though their generalizability is limited to China and the USA due to regional differences in drug pricing, payment systems, and market access.",0.34649406863147314,0.34649406863147314,0.0,0.0,0.6811119571817794,0.6811119571817794,0.801032540647205,0.801032540647205,0.752471511257362,0.6452561874286291,0.5423270446020848,0.7205680224563508,0.5868872890656512,1
41117981,A rare case: solitary fibrous tumor with widespread metastasis on [,2025,"Background Intracranial solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) are rare pericyte neoplasms arising from the meninges. They resemble meningiomas due to their location and are hyperdense on CT. Therefore, they may be a source of pitfalls. However, unlike meningiomas, there is no calcification or hyperostosis of the adjacent bone. We report a rare case of metastatic SFT presenting with masses in the left cerebral hemisphere, both lungs, left kidney, C4 vertebra, and scalp with intense radiotracer uptake. Case presentation A 66-year-old male patient was referred to our center with intracranial masses initially diagnosed as meningiomas. The patient, who developed compression symptoms, underwent surgery for masses in the left cerebral hemisphere. According to WHO classification [1], the pathology revealed as high-risk (grade 3) SFT with high proliferative activity. Immunohistochemical findings: Bcl-2-124 (positive), CD34 (focal pale positive), CD99 (membranous positive), Ki67 (MIB1): %14, PHH3 (positive in 10 cells in per 10 high-power fields), STAT 6 (diffuse nuclear positive). And 10 mitoses were seen in per 10 high-power fields. Imaging results revealed extracranial metastases in addition to intracranial masses, both demonstrating intense radiotracer uptake. Conclusions Although SFTs can be confused with meningiomas based on imaging findings, distinguishing between the two is crucial due to the rarity, aggressive behavior, and potential for extracranial metastasis associated with SFTs. Ga-68 DOTA PET/CT offers significant contributions to the differential diagnosis of these two tumor types. However, it is known in the literature that meningiomas can also exhibit a high rate of DOTA uptake, and, although rare, extracranial metastases can exhibit DOTA positivity. Therefore, a holistic approach to evaluating radiologic, clinical, and histopathologic findings is necessary for definitive diagnosis, rather than relying solely on Ga-68 DOTA PET/CT findings. Furthermore, as seen in this rare case with limited therapeutic options, the high expression of somatostatin receptor raises the possibility of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs as a potential treatment option in the context of widespread metastatic disease.",0.4642079912069706,0.4642079912069706,0.0,0.0,0.5479623059570229,0.5479623059570229,0.5905410098678642,0.5905410098678642,0.48234870700556215,0.3501790016719444,0.48172969086771095,0.30352546817762616,0.43717863519518974,1

The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019 published global age-standardized point prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019. In this study, we analyzed the GBD 2019 data to explore the factors contributing to the burden of anemia in the US. In this secondary analysis of the GBD 2019 data, we extracted point estimates and 95% uncertainty intervals of DALYs to describe the health loss due to anemia in the US between 1990 and 2019. We categorized DALYs based on demographic characteristics and attributed them to anemia-causing conditions, such as dietary iron deficiency (DID), diabetes, kidney diseases, digestive diseases, and obstetric or gynecological conditions. From 1990 to 2019, anemia-related DALYs increased from 332,449 to 418,855 in the US; more than half of the DALYs were due to DID. The rates of DALYs per 100,000 people declined steadily from 1990 until the early 2000s, after which it began to increase steadily. Notably, the rates of DALYs were higher in female individuals than in male individuals for anemia due to DID, diabetes and kidney diseases, and digestive diseases up to the age of 80. There were significant variations in the health burden of anemia across different states, with the highest rates observed in Mississippi, the District of Columbia, and Alabama.

41107521,Engineering a macromolecular JAK inhibitor for treating acute inflammation and endotoxaemia.,2025,"Uncontrolled and sustained inflammation is inextricably associated with the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. However, there is still demand for effective and safe anti-inflammatory therapies. Here we report a potent anti-inflammatory macromolecular therapy named HPL, created by conjugating polyethylene glycol and luminol onto a multivalent and hydrolysable cyclic structure. Leveraging its amphiphilic nature, HPL can spontaneously self-assemble into micelles capable of targeting inflamed tissues and localizing in inflammatory cells. In mice with acute lung, kidney and liver injuries, as well as endotoxaemia, HPL shows anti-inflammatory effects that rivals or surpasses those of two commonly used anti-inflammatory drugs. HPL micelles can act as bioactive and inflammation-responsive carriers for site-specific delivery to release anti-inflammatory drugs. Mechanistically, HPL exerts its anti-inflammatory activity mainly by inhibiting the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway. HPL shows favourable safety profiles in mice at doses at least 5-fold higher than those used in therapeutic studies. These findings suggest that HPL holds great promise as a highly potent, cost-effective and safe JAK2 inhibitor for treating various diseases associated with inflammation.",0.09042598747674926,0.09042598747674926,0.04936400117902514,0.04936400117902514,0.3580705076893132,0.3580705076893132,0.2737620313712464,0.2737620313712464,0.3909602942313976,0.2967541857592087,0.2691508011888419,0.42142662878259407,0.3072197580872799,1

We recruited an international Task Force of experts and followed the EULAR standard operating procedures. We performed systematic literature research (period January 2019 to March 2024), followed by the modified Delphi method, to form questions, elicit expert opinions, and reach consensus. The new evidence was examined, taking into consideration previous updates. The Task Force agreed on 4 overarching principles and 13 recommendations, which were also evaluated for their feasibility and impact on clinical care. These concern the use of kidney biopsy for diagnosis; targets of therapy and treatment milestones; immunomodulatory therapy with antimalarials, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressives (mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, and calcineurin inhibitors), and biologics (belimumab, obinutuzumab, and rituximab); nonimmune therapy (kidney protection, vaccinations, cardiovascular, and bone protection); family planning; and management of kidney failure. Guidance on single-agent or early combination immune therapy, glucocorticoid tapering and withdrawal, duration of immune therapy, and treatment of refractory disease is provided.

PH prevalence is underestimated due to its varying presentation and lack of awareness; delays in diagnosis can lead to substantial burdens on the healthcare system. This retrospective, observational claims analysis evaluated disease burden and cost of care in patients who had PH, PH with CKD, or CKD alone. Data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters databases and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare Fee-for-Service Limited Data Set were assessed during the study period of January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021. PH prevalence was calculated based on the sample population within each data source. The study sample included 326 patients who had PH; applying projection factors to the US population, an estimated 4500 patients had a diagnosis of PH in 2021. Among these patients, 37% were estimated to have PH with CKD (65% of whom had early CKD, 33% had advanced CKD, and 2% had stage reported as unknown). Patients who had CKD alone (n = 845) were matched with patients who had PH with CKD (n = 169). Patients who had PH with CKD were significantly more burdened with kidney stones (p < 0.01) than patients who had CKD alone. Higher rates of pharmacotherapy and medical treatments were observed in patients who had PH with CKD versus patients who had CKD alone. Median semi-annual total all-cause healthcare costs were greater in patients who had PH with CKD than in patients with CKD alone, regardless of CKD stage ($54,154 in patients who had PH with advanced CKD vs. $35,016 in patients with advanced CKD alone; $9,784 in patients who had PH with early CKD vs. $5,572 in patients with early CKD alone). CKD stage progression among patients who had PH is associated with increasing all-cause costs, suggesting that early diagnosis and treatment of PH to limit the progression to advanced CKD could represent an opportunity to alleviate not only PH symptoms, but also the healthcare cost burden.",0.4821463193191362,0.4821463193191362,0.12721563830811444,0.12721563830811444,0.5452068377893738,0.5452068377893738,0.505843517799542,0.505843517799542,0.7026666029049093,0.6553614607483239,0.516673607815449,0.6419968046943164,0.5480044070351658,1

41098225,Navigating the Challenge: Selecting the Optimal Assay for Serum Albumin Measurement.,2025,"Photometric techniques are the most common methods for measuring serum albumin, where albumin binds with an organic dye to form a complex. These methods are popular due to their simplicity, automation potential, speed, and cost-effectiveness, with bromocresol green (BCG) and bromocresol purple (BCP) being the most frequently used dyes. A 2-year-old boy presented with facial swelling, starting around the eyes in the morning and gradually spreading to the face, improving by evening, and accompanied by reduced urine output. He was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome and treated with a high-calorie, high-protein diet, oral prednisolone, furosemide, and intravenous albumin. Despite treatment, his local laboratory's serum albumin level remained consistently low. However, tests from a private lab showed levels higher than the state lab. The nephrology team was informed of this discrepancy and chose to rely on the private lab's results. A comparison study between BCP and BCG methods found a good correlation overall, but Bland-Altman analysis revealed that BCG had a significant positive bias compared to BCP, explaining the lab discrepancies. The study underscored the importance of clinician awareness of different serum albumin measurement methods, noting that BCP is more specific and does not overestimate albumin in kidney disease patients like BCG does.",0.2955381865837308,0.2955381865837308,0.0,0.0,0.4836487008493447,0.4836487008493447,0.3374252356501227,0.3374252356501227,0.6923461924826332,0.6342777658016036,0.40801222275161403,0.6093541473285481,0.45834770389584756,1
41094532,"A pragmatic, randomised, open-label, multi-centre UK registry-facilitated trial evaluating the effect of high-dose cholecalciferol on mortality in patients on dialysis: the SIMPLIFIED trial.",2025,"Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) and is a strong predictor of death from cardiovascular disease, infections and cancer. Currently only 68% of patients in the UK survive 3 years or more on dialysis. Vitamin D replacement typically utilises activated (1α-hydroxylated) vitamin D compounds allowing for impaired renal activation. However, this approach increases blood calcium concentrations and may paradoxically accelerate vitamin D catabolism. Contemporary treatment guidelines recommend replacement with inactive (unhydroxylated) vitamin D The SIMPLIFIED (Survival Improvement with Cholecalciferol in Patients on Dialysis) trial will test whether supplementation with high-dose cholecalciferol improves survival. Adult dialysis patients will be recruited from one of 72 UK renal centres, by local clinicians and research nurses, and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to high-dose open-label cholecalciferol or standard care, stratified by site. Trial outcomes will be captured using existing data sources including Office of National Statistics (ONS) for deaths and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint of the trial is all-cause mortality. Key secondary endpoints include survival free from cardiovascular events, infections and cancers, and quality of life and cost-effectiveness measures utilising the Eq5D tool. Severe adverse event line listings will be generated from HES data for safety reporting. In this superiority trial, it is anticipated that approximately 4200 patients in total will need to be enrolled to observe 2200 deaths over a period of about 7 years, which will yield 90% power to demonstrate a hazard ratio of 0.87. Outcomes for patients on dialysis remain very poor. The pragmatic design of this study leveraging routinely collected data streamlines trial conduct, reducing burden on patients and local site study staff. Furthermore, since cholecalciferol is a low-cost and easy to administer intervention, evidence of benefit could be readily incorporated into dialysis care across healthcare systems globally.

41092928,"Global burden of 292 causes of death in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations, 1990-2023: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.",2025,"Timely and comprehensive analyses of causes of death stratified by age, sex, and location are essential for shaping effective health policies aimed at reducing global mortality. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 provides cause-specific mortality estimates measured in counts, rates, and years of life lost (YLLs). GBD 2023 aimed to enhance our understanding of the relationship between age and cause of death by quantifying the probability of dying before age 70 years (70q0) and the mean age at death by cause and sex. This study enables comparisons of the impact of causes of death over time, offering a deeper understanding of how these causes affect global populations. GBD 2023 produced estimates for 292 causes of death disaggregated by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2023. We used a modelling tool developed for GBD, the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to estimate cause-specific death rates for most causes. We computed YLLs as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. Probability of death was calculated as the chance of dying from a given cause in a specific age period, for a specific population. Mean age at death was calculated by first assigning the midpoint age of each age group for every death, followed by computing the mean of all midpoint ages across all deaths attributed to a given cause. We used GBD death estimates to calculate the observed mean age at death and to model the expected mean age across causes, sexes, years, and locations. The expected mean age reflects the expected mean age at death for individuals within a population, based on global mortality rates and the population's age structure. Comparatively, the observed mean age represents the actual mean age at death, influenced by all factors unique to a location-specific population, including its age structure. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 250-draw distribution for each metric. Findings are reported as counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2023 include a correction for the misclassification of deaths due to COVID-19, updates to the method used to estimate COVID-19, and updates to the CODEm modelling framework. This analysis used 55 761 data sources, including vital registration and verbal autopsy data as well as data from surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. For GBD 2023, there were 312 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 3 country-years of surveillance data, 51 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 144 country-years of other data types that were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The initial years of the COVID-19 pandemic caused shifts in long-standing rankings of the leading causes of global deaths: it ranked as the number one age-standardised cause of death at Level 3 of the GBD cause classification hierarchy in 2021. By 2023, COVID-19 dropped to the 20th place among the leading global causes, returning the rankings of the leading two causes to those typical across the time series (ie, ischaemic heart disease and stroke). While ischaemic heart disease and stroke persist as leading causes of death, there has been progress in reducing their age-standardised mortality rates globally. Four other leading causes have also shown large declines in global age-standardised mortality rates across the study period: diarrhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, stomach cancer, and measles. Other causes of death showed disparate patterns between sexes, notably for deaths from conflict and terrorism in some locations. A large reduction in age-standardised rates of YLLs occurred for neonatal disorders. Despite this, neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of global YLLs over the period studied, except in 2021, when COVID-19 was temporarily the leading cause. Compared to 1990, there has been a considerable reduction in total YLLs in many vaccine-preventable diseases, most notably diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and measles. In addition, this study quantified the mean age at death for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality and found noticeable variation by sex and location. The global all-cause mean age at death increased from 46·8 years (95% UI 46·6-47·0) in 1990 to 63·4 years (63·1-63·7) in 2023. For males, mean age increased from 45·4 years (45·1-45·7) to 61·2 years (60·7-61·6), and for females it increased from 48·5 years (48·1-48·8) to 65·9 years (65·5-66·3), from 1990 to 2023. The highest all-cause mean age at death in 2023 was found in the high-income super-region, where the mean age for females reached 80·9 years (80·9-81·0) and for males 74·8 years (74·8-74·9). By comparison, the lowest all-cause mean age at death occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where it was 38·0 years (37·5-38·4) for females and 35·6 years (35·2-35·9) for males in 2023. Lastly, our study found that all-cause 70q0 decreased across each GBD super-region and region from 2000 to 2023, although with large variability between them. For females, we found that 70q0 notably increased from drug use disorders and conflict and terrorism. Leading causes that increased 70q0 for males also included drug use disorders, as well as diabetes. In sub-Saharan Africa, there was an increase in 70q0 for many non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Additionally, the mean age at death from NCDs was lower than the expected mean age at death for this super-region. By comparison, there was an increase in 70q0 for drug use disorders in the high-income super-region, which also had an observed mean age at death lower than the expected value. We examined global mortality patterns over the past three decades, highlighting-with enhanced estimation methods-the impacts of major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to broader trends such as increasing NCDs in low-income regions that reflect ongoing shifts in the global epidemiological transition. This study also delves into premature mortality patterns, exploring the interplay between age and causes of death and deepening our understanding of where targeted resources could be applied to further reduce preventable sources of mortality. We provide essential insights into global and regional health disparities, identifying locations in need of targeted interventions to address both communicable and non-communicable diseases. There is an ever-present need for strengthened health-care systems that are resilient to future pandemics and the shifting burden of disease, particularly among ageing populations in regions with high mortality rates. Robust estimates of causes of death are increasingly essential to inform health priorities and guide efforts toward achieving global health equity. The need for global collaboration to reduce preventable mortality is more important than ever, as shifting burdens of disease are affecting all nations, albeit at different paces and scales.

41092927,"Global age-sex-specific all-cause mortality and life expectancy estimates for 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations, 1950-2023: a demographic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.",2025,"Comprehensive, comparable, and timely estimates of demographic metrics-including life expectancy and age-specific mortality-are essential for evaluating, understanding, and addressing trends in population health. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of timely and all-cause mortality estimates for being able to respond to changing trends in health outcomes, showing a strong need for demographic analysis tools that can produce all-cause mortality estimates more rapidly with more readily available all-age vital registration (VR) data. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is an ongoing research effort that quantifies human health by estimating a range of epidemiological quantities of interest across time, age, sex, location, cause, and risk. This study-part of the latest GBD release, GBD 2023-aims to provide new and updated estimates of all-cause mortality and life expectancy for 1950 to 2023 using a novel statistical model that accounts for complex correlation structures in demographic data across age and time. We used 24 025 data sources from VR, sample registration, surveys, censuses, and other sources to estimate all-cause mortality for males, females, and all sexes combined across 25 age groups in 204 countries and territories as well as 660 subnational units in 20 countries and territories, for the years 1950-2023. For the first time, we used complete birth history data for ages 5-14 years, age-specific sibling history data for ages 15-49 years, and age-specific mortality data from Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems. We developed a single statistical model that incorporates both parametric and non-parametric methods, referred to as OneMod, to produce estimates of all-cause mortality for each age-sex-location group. OneMod includes two main steps: a detailed regression analysis with a generalised linear modelling tool that accounts for age-specific covariate effects such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and a population attributable fraction (PAF) for all risk factors combined; and a non-parametric analysis of residuals using a multivariate kernel regression model that smooths across age and time to adaptably follow trends in the data without overfitting. We calibrated asymptotic uncertainty estimates using Pearson residuals to produce 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) and corresponding 1000 draws. Life expectancy was calculated from age-specific mortality rates with standard demographic methods. For each measure, 95% UIs were calculated with the 25th and 975th ordered values from a 1000-draw posterior distribution. In 2023, 60·1 million (95% UI 59·0-61·1) deaths occurred globally, of which 4·67 million (4·59-4·75) were in children younger than 5 years. Due to considerable population growth and ageing since 1950, the number of annual deaths globally increased by 35·2% (32·2-38·4) over the 1950-2023 study period, during which the global age-standardised all-cause mortality rate declined by 66·6% (65·8-67·3). Trends in age-specific mortality rates between 2011 and 2023 varied by age group and location, with the largest decline in under-5 mortality occurring in east Asia (67·7% decrease); the largest increases in mortality for those aged 5-14 years, 25-29 years, and 30-39 years occurring in high-income North America (11·5%, 31·7%, and 49·9%, respectively); and the largest increases in mortality for those aged 15-19 years and 20-24 years occurring in Eastern Europe (53·9% and 40·1%, respectively). We also identified higher than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 5-14 years (87·3% higher in GBD 2023 than GBD 2021 on average across countries and territories over the 1950-2021 period) and for females aged 15-29 years (61·2% higher), as well as lower than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 50 years and older (13·2% lower), reflecting advances in our modelling approach. Global life expectancy followed three distinct trends over the study period. First, between 1950 and 2019, there were considerable improvements, from 51·2 (50·6-51·7) years for females and 47·9 (47·4-48·4) years for males in 1950 to 76·3 (76·2-76·4) years for females and 71·4 (71·3-71·5) years for males in 2019. Second, this period was followed by a decrease in life expectancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, to 74·7 (74·6-74·8) years for females and 69·3 (69·2-69·4) years for males in 2021. Finally, the world experienced a period of post-pandemic recovery in 2022 and 2023, wherein life expectancy generally returned to pre-pandemic (2019) levels in 2023 (76·3 [76·0-76·6] years for females and 71·5 [71·2-71·8] years for males). 194 (95·1%) of 204 countries and territories experienced at least partial post-pandemic recovery in age-standardised mortality rates by 2023, with 61·8% (126 of 204) recovering to or falling below pre-pandemic levels. There were several mortality trajectories during and following the pandemic across countries and territories. Long-term mortality trends also varied considerably between age groups and locations, demonstrating the diverse landscape of health outcomes globally. This analysis identified several key differences in mortality trends from previous estimates, including higher rates of adolescent mortality, higher rates of young adult mortality in females, and lower rates of mortality in older age groups in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The findings also highlight stark differences across countries and territories in the timing and scale of changes in all-cause mortality trends during and following the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-23). Our estimates of evolving trends in mortality and life expectancy across locations, ages, sexes, and SDI levels in recent years as well as over the entire 1950-2023 study period provide crucial information for governments, policy makers, and the public to ensure that health-care systems, economies, and societies are prepared to address the world's health needs, particularly in populations with higher rates of mortality than previously known. The estimates from this study provide a robust framework for GBD and a valuable foundation for policy development, implementation, and evaluation around the world.

This paper presents GBD 2023 findings on disease and injury burden and risk-attributable health loss, offering a global audit of the state of world health to inform public health priorities. This work captures the evolving landscape of health metrics across age groups, sexes, and locations, while reflecting on the remaining post-COVID-19 challenges to achieving our collective global health ambitions. The GBD 2023 combined analysis estimated years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 375 diseases and injuries, and risk-attributable burden associated with 88 modifiable risk factors. Of the more than 310 000 total data sources used for all GBD 2023 (about 30% of which were new to this estimation round), more than 120 000 sources were used for estimation of disease and injury burden and 59 000 for risk factor estimation, and included vital registration systems, surveys, disease registries, and published scientific literature. Data were analysed using previously established modelling approaches, such as disease modelling meta-regression version 2.1 (DisMod-MR 2.1) and comparative risk assessment methods. Diseases and injuries were categorised into four levels on the basis of the established GBD cause hierarchy, as were risk factors using the GBD risk hierarchy. Estimates stratified by age, sex, location, and year from 1990 to 2023 were focused on disease-specific time trends over the 2010-23 period and presented as counts (to three significant figures) and age-standardised rates per 100 000 person-years (to one decimal place). For each measure, 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs] were calculated with the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile ordered values from a 250-draw distribution. Total numbers of global DALYs grew 6·1% (95% UI 4·0-8·1), from 2·64 billion (2·46-2·86) in 2010 to 2·80 billion (2·57-3·08) in 2023, but age-standardised DALY rates, which account for population growth and ageing, decreased by 12·6% (11·0-14·1), revealing large long-term health improvements. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contributed 1·45 billion (1·31-1·61) global DALYs in 2010, increasing to 1·80 billion (1·63-2·03) in 2023, alongside a concurrent 4·1% (1·9-6·3) reduction in age-standardised rates. Based on DALY counts, the leading level 3 NCDs in 2023 were ischaemic heart disease (193 million [176-209] DALYs), stroke (157 million [141-172]), and diabetes (90·2 million [75·2-107]), with the largest increases in age-standardised rates since 2010 occurring for anxiety disorders (62·8% [34·0-107·5]), depressive disorders (26·3% [11·6-42·9]), and diabetes (14·9% [7·5-25·6]). Remarkable health gains were made for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases, with DALYs falling from 874 million (837-917) in 2010 to 681 million (642-736) in 2023, and a 25·8% (22·6-28·7) reduction in age-standardised DALY rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, DALYs due to CMNN diseases rose but returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. From 2010 to 2023, decreases in age-standardised rates for CMNN diseases were led by rate decreases of 49·1% (32·7-61·0) for diarrhoeal diseases, 42·9% (38·0-48·0) for HIV/AIDS, and 42·2% (23·6-56·6) for tuberculosis. Neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections remained the leading level 3 CMNN causes globally in 2023, although both showed notable rate decreases from 2010, declining by 16·5% (10·6-22·0) and 24·8% (7·4-36·7), respectively. Injury-related age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 15·6% (10·7-19·8) over the same period. Differences in burden due to NCDs, CMNN diseases, and injuries persisted across age, sex, time, and location. Based on our risk analysis, nearly 50% (1·27 billion [1·18-1·38]) of the roughly 2·80 billion total global DALYs in 2023 were attributable to the 88 risk factors analysed in GBD. Globally, the five level 3 risk factors contributing the highest proportion of risk-attributable DALYs were high systolic blood pressure (SBP), particulate matter pollution, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), smoking, and low birthweight and short gestation-with high SBP accounting for 8·4% (6·9-10·0) of total DALYs. Of the three overarching level 1 GBD risk factor categories-behavioural, metabolic, and environmental and occupational-risk-attributable DALYs rose between 2010 and 2023 only for metabolic risks, increasing by 30·7% (24·8-37·3); however, age-standardised DALY rates attributable to metabolic risks decreased by 6·7% (2·0-11·0) over the same period. For all but three of the 25 leading level 3 risk factors, age-standardised rates dropped between 2010 and 2023-eg, declining by 54·4% (38·7-65·3) for unsafe sanitation, 50·5% (33·3-63·1) for unsafe water source, and 45·2% (25·6-72·0) for no access to handwashing facility, and by 44·9% (37·3-53·5) for child growth failure. The three leading level 3 risk factors for which age-standardised attributable DALY rates rose were high BMI (10·5% [0·1 to 20·9]), drug use (8·4% [2·6 to 15·3]), and high FPG (6·2% [-2·7 to 15·6]; non-significant). Our findings underscore the complex and dynamic nature of global health challenges. Since 2010, there have been large decreases in burden due to CMNN diseases and many environmental and behavioural risk factors, juxtaposed with sizeable increases in DALYs attributable to metabolic risk factors and NCDs in growing and ageing populations. This long-observed consequence of the global epidemiological transition was only temporarily interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The substantially decreasing CMNN disease burden, despite the 2008 global financial crisis and pandemic-related disruptions, is one of the greatest collective public health successes known. However, these achievements are at risk of being reversed due to major cuts to development assistance for health globally, the effects of which will hit low-income countries with high burden the hardest. Without sustained investment in evidence-based interventions and policies, progress could stall or reverse, leading to widespread human costs and geopolitical instability. Moreover, the rising NCD burden necessitates intensified efforts to mitigate exposure to leading risk factors-eg, air pollution, smoking, and metabolic risks, such as high SBP, BMI, and FPG-including policies that promote food security, healthier diets, physical activity, and equitable and expanded access to potential treatments, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Decisive, coordinated action is needed to address long-standing yet growing health challenges, including depressive and anxiety disorders. Yet this can be only part of the solution. Our response to the NCD syndemic-the complex interaction of multiple health risks, social determinants, and systemic challenges-will define the future landscape of global health. To ensure human wellbeing, economic stability, and social equity, global action to sustain and advance health gains must prioritise reducing disparities by addressing socioeconomic and demographic determinants, ensuring equitable health-care access, tackling malnutrition, strengthening health systems, and improving vaccination coverage.

While conventional educational methods offer some benefit, interactive digital tools may yield deeper engagement and sustained behavioral change. This study assesses and compares the impact of interactive and conventional video-based education, as well as usual care, on patient activation, treatment adherence, and inter-dialytic weight gain in individuals undergoing hemodialysis. A three-arm, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial will be conducted in three academic hospitals in Tehran, Iran. A sample of patients will be enrolled and distributed into one of three categories: (1) interactive video education, (2) conventional video education, or (3) typical nurse-led education. The 13-item Patient Activation Measure will be used to measure the primary outcome of patient activation. Secondary outcomes will encompass treatment adherence, as measured by the End Stage Renal Disease Adherence Questionnaire, and inter-dialytic weight gain. Evaluations will occur at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 1- and 3-month follow-up intervals. Data will be analyzed using intention-to-treat principles with mixed-effects modeling. This trial is among the first to rigorously compare interactive and conventional video education in a dialysis population. Findings may inform scalable, cost-effective strategies for improving self-management and adherence in patients with end-stage renal disease.

To compare the effectiveness of sustained exposure to 4 classes of glucose-lowering medications (sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors [DPP4is], sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors [SGLT2is], and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1RAs]) on MACEs in US adults with T2D using modern causal methods combined with machine learning. This comparative effectiveness study included adults with T2D who were members of 6 large US health care delivery systems and initiated treatment with 1 of 4 medication classes (sulfonylureas, DPP4is, SGLT2is, and GLP-1RAs) between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2021. Data analysis was conducted from May 1 to December 31, 2024. New use of a sulfonylurea, DPP4i, SGLT2i, or GLP-1RA based on filled prescriptions. The primary outcome was MACEs defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Analyses were conducted using targeted learning within a trial emulation framework. Heterogeneity of treatment effects was assessed for prespecified subgroups. This study included 296 676 adults. The cohort for emulating a 4-arm trial included a subset of 241 981 adults (mean [SD] age, 57.2 [12.9] years; 54.3% male) with T2D. In adjusted analyses, 2.5-year MACE risk was lowest in patients with sustained exposure to GLP-1RAs, followed by SGLT2is , sulfonylureas, and DPP4is. Comparing DPP4is with sulfonylureas and SGLT2is with GLP-1RAs, the 2.5-year cumulative risk difference was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.1%-2.7%) and 1.5% (1.1%-1.9%), respectively. Risk differences in patients with vs without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) were similar in direction but typically much smaller for patients without ASCVD. Evidence of a benefit of GLP-1RAs over SGLT2is was most pronounced in patients with baseline ASCVD or heart failure (HF), age 65 years or older, or low to moderate kidney impairment but was not found in patients younger than 50 years. In this study, MACE risk varied significantly by medication class, with most protection achieved with sustained treatment with GLP-1RAs followed by SGLT2is, sulfonylureas, and DPP4is. The magnitude of benefit of GLP-1RAs over SGLT2is depended on baseline age, ASCVD, HF, and kidney impairment. These results, along with consideration of cost, availability, and collateral clinical benefits, may inform treatment decisions for adults with T2D.",0.5078000253469392,0.5078000253469392,0.0,0.0,0.13494798853700393,0.13494798853700393,0.21395276153733706,0.21395276153733706,0.21927735259444078,0.19912279976391264,0.29188708736368457,0.314772273044157,0.2976083837838027,1

Studies of post-COVID healthcare utilisation find elevated levels of use but have mainly been conducted in high-income settings. In the context of Brazil's universal health system (SUS), our patient-engaged study aimed to map healthcare needs, use, and access barriers related to LC up to 24 months following COVID-19 hospitalisation, in the interest of informing health system planning for an equitable LC response. A cohort survey included a probabilistic sample of hospitalised COVID-19-confirmed individuals aged ≥ 18, who had been discharged from public hospitals in Rio de Janeiro between December 2020 and November 2022. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected, including self-reported LC symptoms, self-reported LC, healthcare needs, use, and access barriers. In a sample of 556 participants, corresponding to an estimated population of 11,328 individuals, 50.0% (95%CI 44.3-55.6%) reported healthcare needs in the six months prior, due to new-onset or worsened conditions after COVID-19. Almost 45.0% did not complete high school, while 26.5% lived below the poverty line (~ US$6.85 per day), indicating a high proportion of socially vulnerable individuals. High prevalence of LC symptoms, self-reported LC, and new diagnoses were observed. Healthcare needs were associated with acute disease severity, number of LC symptoms, and new post-COVID diagnoses, including cardiovascular and kidney diseases, and endocrine and musculoskeletal disorders. Significant gaps existed between need and access to services, and part of the access to services involved substantial out-of-pocket expenditure. These gaps were particularly pronounced for specialised medical services, scans/imaging, post-COVID rehabilitation services, and mental healthcare. Despite a universal health system, those with higher monthly incomes (above R$1,500 or ~ US$250) were more likely to have accessed specialised medical care. The SUS is not meeting the high need for LC healthcare, raising concerns about deepening health inequities. In Brazil, as elsewhere, LC joins other IACCs in becoming an invisibilised epidemic, with LC patients, especially those unable to pay for care, neglected amid general healthcare backlogs. A comprehensive pandemic response must include dedicated efforts to surveil and treat the long-term impacts of infection.",0.5182285040975355,0.5182285040975355,0.10976920145197885,0.10976920145197885,0.3534585022075229,0.3534585022075229,0.29420723106224,0.29420723106224,0.3456357684769016,0.3394034412073134,0.40382863073752634,0.3264813003085562,0.38449179813028384,1
41087975,Investigating the simultaneous effect of longitudinal biomarkers on long-term kidney transplant failure in Iranian kidney transplant patients: a multivariate joint model.,2025,"In end-stage renal disease, kidney transplantation reduces mortality risk and is more cost-effective than dialysis. Despite advances in transplantation techniques, long-term graft failure remains a significant issue. This study aims to investigate the simultaneous effect of three longitudinal biomarkers-serum creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), and hematocrit-on kidney transplant failure in Iranian kidney transplant patients, and across different subgroups. This retrospective cohort study included 731 kidney transplant patients from multiple hospitals in Mashhad, the capital of a northeastern Iranian province, between 2000 and 2015. After applying the inclusion criteria, data from 558 patients were extracted from medical records. Univariate and multivariate joint models were used to evaluate the impact of longitudinal biomarkers on the risk of kidney graft failure. All statistical analyses were performed at a significance level of 0.05. The multivariate joint model revealed the association between the three longitudinal biomarkers and the risk of transplant failure. The hazard of kidney graft failure increased with higher log-serum creatinine (mg/dL) levels (HR = 1.373, 95% CI: 1.183-1.682) and higher log-BUN (mg/dL) levels (HR = 1.134, 95% CI: 0.948-1.322), while it decreased with higher hematocrit (%) levels (HR = 0.907, 95% CI: 0.813-0.987). The results of this study underscore the importance of multivariate joint modeling for investigating the simultaneous effects of longitudinal biomarkers on the risk of kidney graft failure. This model revealed a simultaneous association between three longitudinal biomarkers-serum creatinine, BUN, and hematocrit-and the risk of graft failure in the study's population.

This analysis sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of RF RDN treatment in the Dutch healthcare setting. A previously published decision-analytic model was utilised to project outcomes over a lifetime horizon for RF RDN vs. standard of care (SoC). Data from the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED study informed the cohort characteristics and base case treatment effect modelled (-4.9 mmHg office-based systolic blood pressure (oSBP) reduction vs. sham), while alternate assumptions were explored in sensitivity analyses. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated against a burden of disease-determined threshold of €20,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained, according to Dutch guidelines. In the base case, ten-year clinical event risk reductions were 0.80 for stroke, 0.88 for myocardial infarction, 0.89 for angina pectoris and coronary heart disease, 0.72 for heart failure, 0.96 for end-stage renal disease, and 0.93 for all-cause death. Over lifetime and under the base case effect size, RF RDN resulted in increased costs of €4,137 (€46,769 (RF RDN) vs. €42,632 (SoC)) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) of 0.61 (17.49 RF RDN vs. 16.88 SoC), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €6,784 per QALY gained. RF RDN was highly cost-effective or dominant across the range of scenario and sensitivity analyses performed.

41083126,The Effectiveness of Medical Nutrition Therapy in Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Disease: A Position Paper of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.,2025,"It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that all individuals with nutrition-related health conditions or risk factors should have access to medical nutrition therapy (MNT) provided by a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). MNT provided by RDNs is effective in improving health outcomes for many chronic conditions that are leading drivers of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in the United States. Widespread access to MNT using an individualized, client-centered, and evidence-based approach has the potential to improve population health, reduce health disparities, and reduce health care costs associated with nutrition-related health conditions. This Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics position paper summarizes recent evidence from systematic reviews on the effectiveness of MNT provided by an RDN for the prevention and treatment of nutrition-related health conditions. A total of 25 systematic reviews published between 2017 and 2024 were summarized and assessed for certainty of evidence. Systematic reviews with high or moderate certainty of evidence demonstrate that MNT is likely effective in improving a range of health outcomes in adults with pre-diabetes, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, obesity, pre-hypertension, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, head and neck cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared to no MNT or standard care. Barriers exist to accessing MNT, including inadequate staffing of RDNs in some areas, lack of provider referrals to an RDN for MNT, and lack of payer coverage and reimbursement.

From 1990 to 2019, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) team performed a comprehensive systematic review of databases and disease-modeled analysis in the NAME countries. Age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and YLD rates, as well as the attributed burden to risk factors (high body mass index (BMI) and kidney dysfunction), were reported with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). The age-standardized YLDs estimated in 2019 and 1990 were 14.2 (95% UI 8.9-20.4) and 15.8 (10.0-22.7) per 100,000 populations, respectively, with an increase of 11.7% (7.1-16.4%) from 1990. The health indicators were all reported to be higher among males. The three countries with higher SDI that had the highest age-standardized YLDs rate in 2019 were Qatar (22.5 [14.5-32.7]), the United Arab Emirates (20.5 [12.9-29.9]), and Kuwait (19.0 [11.7-27.6]), while YLDs in 2019 attributable to high BMI and kidney dysfunction were estimated to be 7.2 (3.8-12.2) and 3.7 (2.3-5.5) per 100,000, respectively. According to our findings, the burden of gout in the NAME is higher than the reported global average and has risen from 1990 to 2019. Despite advances in gout treatment, NAME countries should prioritize preventive interventions to manage the disease's burden. Gout is the most common type of inflammatory arthropathy, and there have been no specific reports of this disease burden in the NAME countries, which account for nearly 8% of the global population.

41079020,"Spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, mortality, amputation, infection and suicide: a retrospective cohort study.",2025,"Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of refractory painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), although the current evidence for efficacy is limited by small sample sizes and short follow-up. We aimed to assess the benefits of SCS, compared to combination pharmacotherapy (gabapentinoid plus duloxetine), in a large population of PDN patients using real-world evidence. We performed a real-world cohort study of electronic medical records using the TriNetX network, a global federated database (9th September 2024). The treatment arm was patients with PDN (defined as diabetes plus neuropathic pain treatment) treated with SCS (refractory to pharmacotherapy), compared against a reference arm of patients treated with gabapentinoid and duloxetine combination therapy. We propensity score matched (1:1) for confounders with 3 years of follow-up. The primary outcome was time-to incident major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE, that is, a composite outcome of non-fatal ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular accident or heart failure, or sudden cardiac death) and secondary outcomes included time-to all-cause mortality, below-knee amputation (BKA), suicide (suicidal ideation and/or attempt), staphylococcus aureus infection, major adverse kidney events (end stage renal failure and/or dialysis), diabetes-related ophthalmic disease (retinopathy and/or maculopathy), hospitalisation and SCS explantation. All outcomes were assessed using ICD-10/CPT codes. Stratified analyses assessed the impact of sex, ethnicity, age, geographic location (USA) and discontinuation of analgesia post SCS implantation on these outcomes. We identified 145,380 patients, with 3212 treated with SCS and 142,168 treated with dual pharmacotherapy alone. After PSM, 3105 patients were included in each arm. Treatment with SCS significantly reduced the risk of MACE (hazard ratio 0.57 [95% CI 0.49, 0.67]), all-cause mortality (0.49 [0.39, 0.62]), BKA amputation (0.19 [0.08, 0.46]), suicide (0.36 [0.22, 0.59]), staphylococcus aureus infection (0.67 [0.51, 0.90]), MAKE (0.46 [0.27, 0.79]), diabetes-related ophthalmic disease (0.33 [0.23, 0.48]) and hospitalisation (0.59 [0.53, 0.66]), compared with combination pharmacotherapy. 11.1% of SCS patients underwent explant. Female and older patients had greater reductions in BKA and infection with SCS, whilst the associated reduced risk of suicide was most prominent in younger adults. Our results suggest that SCS treatment of PDN is associated with a reduced risk of MACE, all-cause mortality, major amputation, suicide, and staphylococcus aureus infection. The findings provide evidence for the putative benefits of SCS as treatment for PDN. Prospective sham controlled RCTs with pain endpoint whilst incorporating longer term follow-up of CV/mortality outcomes are needed to confirm the benefits and explore cost-effectiveness of SCS.

41069901,Beginning of ABO-Incompatible Transplants in Pakistan: A Single-Centre Experience.,2025,"Background The burden of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is ever-increasing in Pakistan. Among the treatment options available, kidney transplantation remains the most effective treatment for ESRD, offering improved quality of life and survival benefits over dialysis. ABO blood group incompatibility has traditionally been viewed as a barrier to transplantation. However, we have started ABO-incompatible (ABOi) renal transplant in Pakistan since 2023 with good clinical outcomes. Objectives This study aims to document the initiation of ABOi renal transplants in Pakistan, while evaluating clinical outcomes, immunological responses, and long-term graft survival rates, with a focus on the development and further improvement of pre-transplant desensitisation regimens. Methods A retrospective study was conducted at our centre on ABOi renal transplants from February 2023 to March 2025. A total of 15 ABOi renal transplants were included. The desensitisation protocol developed included immunomodulation with rituximab, followed by low-dose immunosuppression and membrane plasma separation for preformed antibody depletion. Induction therapy was performed using anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg/day), mycophenolate mofetil or MMF (2000 mg/day), and prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day). All patients were given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 on alternate days for six months as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), valganciclovir 450 mg per day against cytomegalovirus (CMV) for three months, and fluconazole 50 mg per day for one month as antifungal prophylaxis. Results The highest antibody titers pre-transplant were 1/512 (IgG) and 1/256 (IgM). Five sessions of plasmapheresis were done for 13 (86.7%) patients, while two (13.3%) underwent immunoadsorption (IA). The cutoff of 1:4 was established to go ahead with the transplant. Overall graft survival was 86.7%. Three (20.0%) patients developed cellular rejection, which was successfully treated. One (6.7%) patient died with a functioning graft due to secondary complications. The main complications encountered were development of lymphocele, urinary leakage, lower respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection. Conclusion We conclude that the ABOi renal transplants in Pakistan show favourable results. Further adoption of this method can expand the donor pool for patients with ESRD.",0.45283330617915685,0.45283330617915685,0.11424075921035856,0.11424075921035856,0.8844524883470022,0.8844524883470022,0.9811043656799034,0.9811043656799034,0.9593451088181669,0.836856726292065,0.6947529670197357,0.9675072190239719,0.7629415300207947,1
41068227,Triglyceride-glucose index predicts the mortality risk among incident peritoneal dialysis patients in a cohort study.,2025,"Insulin resistance (IR) frequently cause higher levels of fasting glucose and triglyceride. Triglyceride- glucose (TyG) index has been suggested as a simple, reliable, and cost-effective surrogate for IR. We conducted the present study to assess whether TyG index is associated with increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality among our PD cohort. This observational study included 553 patients initiating PD between 2003 and 2017 who were divided into three groups by TyG tertiles. The study exposure was the TyG index at study enrollment. Associations of TyG index with patient mortality were examined in Cox models and the potential confounding covariates included medication use, demographic, comorbidities, PD-associated and laboratory data. The optimal cut-off points of TyG index were also determined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and area under ROC curve (AUC) was calculated. During follow-up, 142 patients died, of whom 89 CV deaths occurred. The risks of all-cause and CV mortality increased with tertiles of TyG index. In the multivariable-adjusted models, the hazard ratios (HRs) in tertile 3 versus tertile 1 were 2.12 (95% CI 1.31-3.43, p = 0.021) and 2.78 (95% CI 1.34-5.76, p = 0.006) for all-cause and CV mortality, respectively. Those independent associations remained even when TyG index was treated as a continuous variable, or per 1-standard deviation increase. The cut-off point of TyG index was 8.79 (62.7% sensitivity and 61.6% specificity) with AUC of 0.652 and 8.85 (66.3% sensitivity and 62.9% specificity) with AUC of 0.681 for all-cause and CV mortality, respectively. Elevated levels of TyG index significantly predicted increased risks of all-cause and CV mortality in patients initiating PD. More studies are required to compare with other surrogates of insulin sensitivity and extrapolated to other ethnic populations.",0.1766441201830091,0.1766441201830091,0.04368192849777026,0.04368192849777026,0.3053953800018844,0.3053953800018844,0.4847518318411016,0.4847518318411016,0.4012873008922997,0.31719878188597345,0.2986492992283631,0.29250919107849255,0.2971142721908954,1

Hospitalizations due to cardiovascular (CV) events, particularly for decompensated HF, represent most CKD-related costs. Cardiorenal units (CRU) emerge as an innovative strategy to address this complexity through a multidisciplinary approach. This study analyses the effectiveness and efficiency of CRUs. Observational, longitudinal, prospective, and single-centre study using an adapted interrupted time-series design. Patients with advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m In 55 patients (mean age 73.9 ± 8.6 years; 78% male), a 65% reduction in emergency department visits (p = 0.0001) and a 60.5% reduction in hospitalizations (p = 0.0015) were observed. The economic analysis revealed cost savings of approximately ;700,000, with an average reduction of almost ;13,000 per patient/year. After inclusion in the CRU, there was an increased prescription of prognostic drugs, with no significant changes in serum potassium concentration (p = 0.26) and no evidence of renal function deterioration (pre-vs. post-eGFR: 23.36 ± 7.6 mg/dl vs. 22.44 ± 8.5 mg/dl; p = 0.17).

Here, we describe the burden and management of C3G in global clinical practice. Retrospective analysis of data obtained from a cross-sectional survey (Adelphi Real World C3G Disease Specific Programme™) of nephrologists actively managing C3G ( Records for 385 patients with C3G were completed by 129 nephrologists. Most patients had moderate to severe disease at the time of diagnosis (85.1%), based on individual nephrologist assessment. At the time of PRF completion, 83.4% of patients were receiving pharmacological treatment, which included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (70.4%) and corticosteroids (48.6%). In patients receiving treatment, proteinuria remained the most common nephrologist-reported sign of C3G (66.0%), irrespective of treatment duration; of patients with available data, 68.9% had proteinuria ≥1 g/day. At the time of PRF completion, 8.3% of patients were on dialysis, 41.6% of patients were considered eligible for a kidney transplant, and 6.5% were transplant recipients. Patients experienced anxiety/depression (73.7%), pain/discomfort (65.3%), fatigue (90.7%), and problems doing usual activities (62.7%) at the time of PSCF completion. Despite most patients receiving current guideline-recommended standard of care, the burden of C3G remains high worldwide, demonstrating the need for more effective treatment options. In addition, most patients presented with advanced disease by the time of diagnosis, warranting a need to address significant diagnostic delays to facilitate earlier therapeutic intervention.",0.4324369089643865,0.4324369089643865,0.0,0.0,0.5046683226654417,0.5046683226654417,0.6465414101872017,0.6465414101872017,0.7508814153276916,0.6776692379203174,0.49244665930334114,0.6526807490617725,0.5325051817429489,1
41063263,"Estimates of non-communicable disease expenditure by disease phase, sex, and age group for all OECD countries.",2025,"NCD expenditure estimates are necessary to estimate future health system expenditure trajectories for different prevention and treatment policies. However, no dataset of comparable estimates exists across OECD countries. This study generates disease expenditure estimates for all 38 OECD member countries in 2019, for 80 major NCDs by disease phase, sex, and age group. Australian health expenditure (per person) by sex and age group was disaggregated by disease phase (first year of diagnosis, last year of life if dying of disease, otherwise prevalent) using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data and New Zealand estimates of relative expenditure ratios by phase. These estimates were applied to GBD estimated case numbers in each OECD country and scaled to each country's total health system expenditure to estimate expenditure by NCDs in 2019. OECD purchasing power parities were used to adjust estimates to United States (US) dollars for cross-country comparability. Comparisons were made to pre-existing disease expenditure estimates for Norway, Switzerland, and the US. Average NCD expenditure across OECD countries was US$207 million per 100,000 population. Pooled across countries, musculoskeletal disorders had the highest proportion of total health expenditure (17.4%), followed by cancer (9.4%), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (9.1%). Within diseases, the percentage of expenditure was higher for females for musculoskeletal disorders (56.1%), mental and substance use disorders (55.8%), and neurological conditions (54.8%). For males, it was kidney and urinary diseases (63.8%), cancer (58.3%), and CVD (50.7%). First year of diagnosis represented on average 36.8% of total NCD expenditure, while last year of life expenditure accounted for 2.6%. While there were similarities between our expenditure estimates and pre-existing country-specific estimates for Norway, Switzerland and the US, notable differences were observed for musculoskeletal disorders, cancer, and mental and substance use disorders. Our estimates represent a starting point for a cross-national dataset of disease-specific expenditure that can be used to forecast future expenditure and potential health system cost savings of preventive and treatment policies. We recommend evolving our paper's methods to include multiple country-level studies as inputs - augmented by covariates (e.g. GDP, public/private split) to better predict disease expenditure.",0.27387542685253913,0.27387542685253913,0.2642081911964228,0.2642081911964228,0.22368861734121936,0.22368861734121936,0.25900663050074707,0.25900663050074707,0.242332486317862,0.1830673155190023,0.28404511638674873,0.1876843689678082,0.2599549295320136,1

However, it can be challenging to implement in safety-net systems that disproportionately serve low-income and/or racial/ethnic minority populations at risk of worse hypertension outcomes. We therefore propose a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-level implementation strategies to increase the use of SMBP monitoring in two urban safety-net systems. We will conduct a patient-level randomized controlled trial with 330 English-, Spanish-, and Chinese (Cantonese)-speaking patients with uncontrolled hypertension across six study sites with patients randomized to a low-intensity (SMBP education, text message education and reminders) vs. high-intensity intervention (adds group classes and engagement of identified caregivers). To support increased use of SMBP data by the clinical team, we will concurrently deliver a staggered roll-out of a clinic-level implementation strategy (clinic education, shadowing, auditing with feedback, and optimization of electronic health record [EHR] use). The primary outcomes will be clinic-measured systolic BP (SBP) among enrolled participants for the patient-level intervention and among all patients assigned to the clinic for the clinic-level intervention. We will additionally collect secondary clinical outcomes (BP control, home SBP), implementation outcomes (adoption, reach, and costs), and patient-reported outcomes (patient activation). The results of this trial will address gaps in identifying cost-conscious implementation strategies for increasing adoption of SMBP in safety-net systems with the overarching goal of improving blood pressure control in low-income, diverse patient populations.

The long-term impact of BK viremia remains unclear. We performed a single-center retrospective study on 1058 consecutive kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant recipients. We classified the cohort based on the presence or absence of BK viremia, BK viral loads, persistence of BK viremia, and pre-existing or de novo DSA. Outcomes included mortality, graft loss, death-censored graft survival (DCGS), estimated glomerular filtration rate, biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), de novo DSA, ureteral stenosis, and genitourinary (GU) malignancies. Over a median follow-up period of 9.7 years, there was no difference in graft loss (p = 0.08) and mortality (p = 0.56). Time-varying multivariable analysis showed no difference in DCGS [HR 1.02, (0.91-1.16)]. Compared to never BK viremic patients, patients with BK viremia had similar graft function at 5 and 10 years (p = 0.09 and 0.65, respectively), rates of GU malignancies (7.0% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.35) and ureteral stenosis (0.8% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.63). Patients with BK viral loads >10 000 copies/mL had a higher risk of de novo DSA [HR 1.71, (1.08-2.68)] and BPAR [HR 2.11, (1.28-3.47)]. BK viremia did not impact mortality, graft loss, kidney function, GU malignancies, and ureteral stenosis over long-term follow-up, but BPAR episodes and development of de novo DSA were higher with viral loads >10 000 copies/mL.

41053669,Economic cost of end-stage renal disease in Africa: a systematic review.,2025,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and irreversible condition that contributes substantially to global morbidity and mortality. In Africa, the burden of CKD is compounded by limited healthcare resources, poverty, and the dual challenge of communicable and non-communicable diseases. The economic impact of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is considerable, yet evidence from the region remains scarce. This systematic review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines, examined the economic burden of ESRD in Africa. Data were extracted on study characteristics, patient populations, cost components, and financing mechanisms. All reported costs were standardized to 2025 USD. Eighteen studies, involving 2,634 patients, were included. The majority received haemodialysis (HD) (95.9%), with limited data on peritoneal dialysis (PD) (2.7%) and kidney transplantation (1.4%). Annual HD costs varied widely, from $2,003.48 in Burkina Faso to $41,957.69 in South Africa, with a pooled median of $18,741.00. PD costs, reported in three studies, ranged from $11,161.98 in Egypt to $47,837.05 in South Africa. First-year transplantation costs plus follow-up varied between $33,120.18 in Cameroon and $46,293.59 in Nigeria. Direct medical costs dominated expenditures, with drugs and laboratory investigations representing major cost drivers.

This study aimed to assess treatment adherence in relation to health literacy (HL) and digital healthy diet literacy (DDL) levels of patients receiving hemodialysis in Lebanon. A multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted during 2021-2023. It included patients in 18 dialysis centers based on nonprobability sampling. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18+ years and Arabic speakers. Severe illness, dementia, and confusion were exclusion criteria. Sociodemographic factors (marital status, education, governorate, employment, financial means, and fear of coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) were assessed as predictors of adherence and HL. The primary outcomes were HL scores (Health Literacy Scale- Short Form 12), DDL scores (Digital Healthy Diet Literacy Scale), and adherence to treatment scores (treatment adherence questionnaire). Bivariate analysis identified associations between patient characteristics and scores on scales. Simple linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship between scores and independent variables. Participants (N = 699, 64.5% male patients) showed below-average HL levels (18.96 ± 11.79) and DDL (15.95 ± 14.58), and moderate adherence behavior (995.82 ± 178.99). Single patients and those with higher educational and employment statuses had higher levels of HL. Regional disparities were observed. Individuals who did not experience financial difficulty in covering their treatment cost, and those who had less fear from COVID-19, showed higher DDL scores. Single individuals displayed lower treatment adherence. This study is limited by its cross-sectional design, and by contextual factors that affected patient attendance and researcher access to hemodialysis centers, along with overrepresentation of private facilities.

41045345,Inflammation and immune biomarkers: new frontiers in understanding and managing diabetes complications.,2025,"Chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation are central to the development and progression of diabetes complications, redefining existing paradigms of disease pathogenesis and management. Key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), contribute to tissue injury in the vasculature, kidneys, retina, and peripheral nerves by activating systemic and local inflammatory cascades. Emerging evidence highlights the utility of haematological inflammatory biomarkers such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) as accessible, cost-effective predictors of risk for both microvascular and macrovascular complications in diabetes. These markers reflect the ongoing immune activation linked to insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Integrating these biomarkers with genomic and proteomic data enhances precision medicine approaches for complication risk stratification and individualized therapy. Novel anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory treatments, alongside lifestyle interventions, show promise in mitigating chronic inflammation's effects, potentially reducing the burden of diabetic complications beyond conventional glycaemic control. This review critically appraises the molecular mechanisms of immune-mediated damage in diabetes, evaluates the prognostic and diagnostic value of emerging inflammatory biomarkers, and discusses therapeutic advances aimed at targeting inflammation.

To estimate the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of accelerated KRT initiation compared with standard KRT initiation in critically ill patients with AKI. In this economic evaluation, a state-transition model was developed using data from the Standard vs Accelerated Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy in AKI (STARRT-AKI) trial, a multicenter, multinational randomized clinical trial of critically ill patients with severe AKI conducted between October 2015 and September 2019. Trial data were linked to administrative health databases in Alberta, Canada, to estimate costs and long-term clinical outcomes. The model included 4 health states: no chronic kidney disease, severe chronic kidney disease, KRT dependent, and dead. Costs are reported in 2024 Canadian dollars. Data were analyzed from February 2022 to November 2024. Initiation of KRT. The primary outcome for the economic evaluation was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The QALY is a combined measure of patient quality of life and length of life. Expected costs, QALYs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) were estimated on the basis of 5000 Monte Carlo simulations. A total of 146 patients from the STARRT-AKI trial were included in the analysis, with 73 patients (mean [SD] age, 59.67 [14.5] years; 52 men [71.3%]) randomized to receive accelerated initiation and 73 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.88 [12.9] years; 48 men [65.8%]) randomized to receive standard initiation. Standard initiation was more costly per patient than accelerated initiation (mean [SD], $251 370 [$155 801] vs $231 518 [$183 302]) but generated more QALYs (mean [SD] 7.49 [2.03] QALYs vs 6.64 [1.76] QALYs). The ICER of standard initiation compared with accelerated initiation was $23 208, with an INMB of $22 648 (95% credible interval, $15 980-$29 316) when assuming a willingness to pay per QALY of $50 000.

We developed a simplified and cost-effective method for adapting BHK-21 cells to suspension culture using a progressive accelerated rolling system, eliminating the need for microcarriers or complex bioreactor systems. The resulting suspension-adapted cells (BHK-S) were assessed for growth kinetics, sterility, postthaw viability, and their ability to support FMDV replication and 146S antigen production. Conversion of adherent BHK-21 to BHK suspension was performed, followed by investigation of cell counts, cell viability, cell morphology, and growth curve analysis. BHK-S cells demonstrated robust growth with >95% viability and a density of 2 × 10 This streamlined and scalable approach for adapting BHK-21 cells to suspension culture offers a practical and affordable alternative for FMD vaccine production in resource-limited settings, facilitating the transition from bench-to-bioprocessing scale.",0.2607884820173905,0.2607884820173905,0.09731655345133373,0.09731655345133373,0.48299175042482,0.48299175042482,0.498378063868939,0.498378063868939,0.43845991556826497,0.3252842668923596,0.3950403281089627,0.3639532364688919,0.387268555198945,1
41024507,"Global, regional, and national burden of diabetes and kidney diseases, 1990-2021: a trend and health inequality analyses based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",2025,"Diabetes and kidney diseases pose a major global public health challenge, impacting both health and socioeconomic development. Comprehensive analyses combining long-term trend decomposition (1990-2021) and inequality measurements are lacking. Using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021, we conducted comprehensive analyses to examine the disease burden through two complementary approaches (1): decomposition analysis to quantify the relative contributions of population growth, aging effects, and epidemiologic changes; and (2) inequality assessment using both the slope index of inequality and concentration index to evaluate socioeconomic disparities in disease burden across countries. According to GBD 2021, the global figures for diabetes and kidney diseases in 2021 included 1,081,017,594 prevalent cases, 44,905,586 incident cases, 123,704,574 DALYs, and 3,195,034 deaths. The age-standardized rates (ASR) of estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) for both prevalence and incidence were positive across all countries and territories, denoting an upward trend. Population (36.92%), aging (28.64%), and epidemiologic change (i.e., changes in age-specific disease risk independent of demographic shifts, driven by diagnostics, risk factors, or treatments; 34.44%) were key drivers over 1990-2021. Significant absolute and relative inequalities in the burden of diabetes and kidney diseases, measured by sociodemographic index (SDI), were observed and showed a substantial increase over time. Understanding these patterns-particularly the rising burden in high-SDI nations and widening cross-country inequalities-is crucial for tailoring interventions for diabetes and kidney diseases.",0.30322479186987233,0.30322479186987233,0.14245356305773493,0.14245356305773493,0.3407123217253769,0.3407123217253769,0.603455743188104,0.603455743188104,0.3594171101803387,0.4373590041098105,0.374646486503935,0.3994313568857887,0.38084270409939847,1
41024006,"A qualitative exploration of the patient disease and treatment burden of end stage renal failure, Post-Renal transplantation and antibody mediated rejection (AMR).",2025,"End stage renal disease (ESRD) is the irreversible decline in an individual's kidney function. In severe cases it can be fatal if dialysis or transplantation is not sought. Renal transplantation is associated with longer life expectancies and improved quality of life and is often the preferred treatment over chronic dialysis for those with ESRD. After kidney transplant, patients are at risk of infections, and complications such as allograft rejection. Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) is one of the most common causes of allograft failure. There is currently no approved medication for the prevention or treatment of AMR after transplantation. Whereas the patient-reported symptoms and impacts of ESRD and of kidney transplant have been widely documented, a paucity of these data specific to the population at high risk of or with active AMR is evident. We conducted qualitative interviews and analysis with 14 patients with ESRD on the waiting list for a kidney transplant, and 19 patients who had received a kidney transplant (patients post-transplant without AMR (n = 12), and patients post-transplant at high risk of or with active AMR (n = 7)). A total of 52 symptoms and 69 impacts were reported across the populations with ESRD and post-transplant. New concepts emerged from the interviews that had not been reported in previous literature. The patients with AMR in our study reported mostly negative symptoms but continued to experience many benefits of transplant such as increased energy, an absence of dry or itching skin, an absence of urological and neuropathic symptoms and fewer symptoms overall. Negative impacts were most often related to emotional, physical, and social functioning, and positive impacts most frequently reported for overall health, activities of daily living and quality of life. Patients post-transplant both with and without AMR reported improvements in quality of life compared to before their transplant. However, although patients with AMR reported a number of positive impacts, fewer were mentioned, and less frequently than by patients post-transplant without AMR; a return to normalcy, increased social interaction, and improved diet and lifestyle are all examples of this. Our research allowed the development of a conceptual disease model specific to patients with AMR. The qualitative exploration of patient experience of symptoms and impacts carried out in our study underlines the heterogeneity of experience and the burden of disease and treatment experienced by patients at all stages of disease and treatment, from ESRD, to AMR of the kidney transplant. Eliciting these data directly from patients, analyzing and presenting these concepts in conceptual disease models is an essential step towards relevant and accurate measurement of patient experience in these populations.",0.617697806171671,0.617697806171671,0.4838705856609751,0.4838705856609751,0.6270879822611973,0.6270879822611973,0.6906199340237633,0.6906199340237633,0.7841288907096396,0.7407232461624946,0.648481794455001,0.685982057422853,0.657856860196964,1
41021268,Albumin prevents kidney injury but is underutilized in a cohort of patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis.,2025,"Cirrhosis and cirrhosis-related deaths have risen in the United States in recent years. Ascites is a common complication, often requiring large-volume paracentesis (LVP). The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends the administration of albumin in conjunction with LVP to prevent further complications of cirrhosis. Emerging research in cirrhosis care reveals significant variations in outcomes among different demographics. Therefore, we assessed the use of guideline-adherent albumin and outcomes in U.S. patients undergoing LVPs, particularly at the intersection of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic disparities, and cirrhosis. This retrospective study utilized Cerner Real World Data to identify adults with cirrhosis and ascites undergoing LVP between January 2016 and June 2022. We assessed albumin utilization patterns across racial and ethnic groups and payor types, and their overall impact on acute kidney injury (AKI)-related hospitalization using an adjusted generalized linear model (aGLM). We identified 736 patients: 301 in the LVP + albumin group and 435 in the LVP-only group. Despite clinical recommendations, only 41% undergoing LVPs received albumin. White patients and commercially insured patients received albumin at higher rates (p=0.042 and p=0.009, respectively). The overall rate of AKI-related admissions within the 30-day post-procedure period was 26%. However, patients who received albumin during LVP had a 36% lower risk of short-term AKI-related hospitalization (OR: 0.64; p=0.03). These findings indicate a potential for broader albumin utilization in U.S. patients with refractory ascites undergoing repeated LVPs to reduce AKI-related admissions.",0.19202556771075616,0.19202556771075616,0.3154930798954765,0.3154930798954765,0.42981556556741035,0.42981556556741035,0.46349820870079517,0.46349820870079517,0.6452805979073842,0.5126937057018043,0.39384096230190707,0.5527173114037256,0.4335600495773617,1
41019087,Isolated C3 hypocomplementemia as an early predictor of chronic kidney disease in lupus nephritis.,2025,"The role of complement in the long-term renal survival of patients with lupus nephritis (LN) remains poorly understood. Recent studies suggest its potential impact; however, long-term data are lacking. This multicenter, observational, retrospective study aimed at investigating the influence of complement levels on long-term renal outcomes in LN patients. We evaluated whether isolated C3 hypocomplementemia (i-LowC3), defined as serum low C3 (≤80 mg/dL) and normal C4 (>10 mg/dL) six months after kidney biopsy is associated with subsequent risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) or death. 445 patients with LN were studied (median follow-up 4.9 years). Based on six-month C3/C4 levels, patients were categorized into i-LowC3 (91 patients) and controls (354 patients). Over the first six months, serum C3 and C4 levels increased by a median of 20 mg/dL and 5 mg/dL, respectively. i-LowC3 was significantly associated with twice the risk of a poor outcome, including CKD, ESKD, composite outcome of CKD or death and ESKD or death, with lower survival rates for all these outcomes compared to controls (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed a lower risk of CKD and CKD or death with increases in C3 levels during the first six months, while i-LowC3 was associated with an independent higher risk for these outcomes. The trajectory of serum C3 levels within the first six months appears to predict long-term renal prognosis of LN patients. These findings support the use of i-LowC3 as a low-cost, readily available biomarker to guide early treatment of LN patients.",0.26101485695036036,0.26101485695036036,0.09731655345133373,0.09731655345133373,0.3146697171130525,0.3146697171130525,0.1342543175644356,0.1342543175644356,0.6041848935955866,0.516036207041581,0.3176070002081118,0.49410665076600213,0.3617319128475844,1
41018786,Evaluating disease burden in chronic kidney disease screening using a micro-simulation model.,2025,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a high prevalence, poor prognosis, and high medical costs, and awareness of the disease is low. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to simulate and analyze the evolution of CKD burden among different groups at high risk of CKD in Shanghai, with or without screening intervention, and provide a quantifiable basis for the selection of screening intervention strategies for CKD. A micro-simulation model was constructed to analyze the evolution of CKD burden using data from CKD screening of the population in the Jing'an and Minhang Districts of Shanghai, China, from January 2015 to December 2020. SAS Statistical Software 9.4 was used to simulate and analyze the evolution of disease burden under different screening intervention strategies. By 2033, screening interventions for high-risk groups with hypertension, diabetes, and an age of 65 years and older would be associated with 6,250 fewer patients with end-stage renal disease. Furthermore, the number of patients with end-stage renal disease would be reduced to only 41.64% of the projected number of patients without screening intervention, leading to a general improvement in the quality of life of the population, better quality-adjusted life-years, and a reduction in the economic burden of disease. The results of this study highlight the importance of combining the concepts of integrated prevention and treatment of chronic diseases to improve screening and intervention of CKD for people with hypertension, diabetes, and those aged 65 years and older, thereby effectively reducing the number of patients with end-stage renal disease, lowering the cost of treatment and intervention, and improving the quality of life of the population.",0.5864477784291292,0.5864477784291292,0.047809263779738674,0.047809263779738674,0.5615927127718335,0.5615927127718335,0.5876918271435636,0.5876918271435636,0.6573921958697745,0.6670641277003085,0.552264708269715,0.458366776503369,0.5287902253281285,1
41018277,Pathways to translation for nanomedicine in nephrology.,2025,"Kidney diseases are a substantial worldwide health burden, with high mortality and increasing incidence. Despite their prevalence, substantial gaps remain in the clinic in both diagnostics and therapeutics. Many novel treatments have failed in clinical trials or fallen out of use in the clinic due to side effects and poor efficacy, in large part due to poor therapeutic profiles in the kidney. Nanomedicines have begun to emerge as a potentially promising diagnostic or therapeutic delivery system. Based on their physicochemical properties, such as size, shape, surface chemistry, and so on, some nanotechnologies can target the kidneys. However, as of yet, no kidney-specific nanomedicines have reached clinical translation. While the field of renal nanomedicine is in its early stages and growing, some potential obstacles to translation include poor preclinical models, challenges in manufacturing scale-up, clinical trial design and the cost of translation. Here, we overview the current state of the kidney-targeting nanomedicine field and outline a potential framework for clinical translation. We focus on the paths of US Food and Drug Administration- approved nanomedicines and suggestions from other nanomedicine fields to inform our key considerations for translational success.

These modules aim to improve knowledge, screening practices, skills, and self-management behaviours. This Delphi study aims to provide a prioritized list of strategies, content, and delivery methods to guide future implementation efforts and improve primary and secondary prevention of conservative CKD care in Syria. A second-round Delphi study was performed using the input of 15 CKD clinical content experts (nephrologist-scientist & medical educator) involved in education and clinical practice from March to the end of April 2025. Eligible participants sent an e-mail containing an information sheet and an invitation to participate in the study. Consent is obtained before participants proceed to the survey. In the first round, we identified several potential strategies for CKD prevention education. However, consensus was not reached on all of them. We modified and refined these strategies based on the CKD clinical content experts ' opinions. We asked them to re-evaluate and re-rank these modified strategies in the second round via e-mail. Experts use predefined statements to score the effectiveness of CKD prevention strategies and delivery methods based on existing best practices specified in clinical guidelines, systematic reviews, and research studies. Descriptive statistics such as the median, interquartile range (IQR), and percentage agreement are used to assess consensus. Inferential statistics were used to measure participant agreement using Kendall's coefficient, and for stability between rounds, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used. We identified (9 primary and 32 secondary strategies) evidence-based CKD prevention strategies to implement within Syria and limited resource areas. Three strategies were deleted as not feasible and related to the Syrian context, and nine strategies were modified based on expert feedback on rationale and suggestions related to culture availability and cost-effectiveness. We added one strategy to replace the Genetic screening strategies with early and regular screening for high-risk populations. Challenges to implementing evidence-based CKD prevention strategies seem to exist in professional, organizational, and external contexts, which should all be considered to increase implementation success within resource-limited areas such as Syria. Using the Delphi approach to tailor the e-learning module content to the specific needs of nurses, depending on the realities of the Syrian context, by synthesizing clinical work with evidence-based CKD prevention strategies and an obvious need to create a common foundation for nurses' knowledge of CKD prevention.

41010881,Rethinking the Diabetes-Cardiovascular Disease Continuum: Toward Integrated Care.,2025,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are not merely coexisting epidemics but co-evolving manifestations of a shared cardiometabolic continuum. Despite advances in glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure control, residual cardiovascular risk remains high, underscoring the limitations of siloed approaches. In this perspective, we argue for reframing T2D and CVD as interconnected conditions driven by inflammation, adipose tissue dysfunction, and organ crosstalk. Beyond metformin, which remains foundational, several glucose-lowering drug classes are now evaluated not only for glycemic control but also for their cardiovascular and renal impact. Landmark trials and recent meta-analyses confirm that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists improve cardiorenal outcomes. More recently, tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptor agonist, has shown unprecedented efficacy in weight and glucose management, with potential to further transform cardiometabolic risk reduction. Yet enthusiasm for these therapies must be tempered by heterogeneity of response, treatment costs, and inequitable access. Integrated care models, supported by multidisciplinary teams, digital health tools, and value-based reimbursement, are essential to close the gap between trial efficacy and real-world outcomes. Attention to sex, age, ethnicity, and comorbidity profiles is critical to ensure equity, as is the adaptation of strategies to low- and middle-income countries where the burden of cardiometabolic disease is rapidly rising. Ultimately, advancing cardiometabolic medicine requires not only novel therapies but also a unifying framework that integrates biology, behavior, economics, and health systems to deliver the right treatment to the right patient at the right time.",0.4380053580388582,0.4380053580388582,0.0,0.0,0.27579407917038606,0.27579407917038606,0.279803871011073,0.279803871011073,0.5466101004436534,0.6127245508780871,0.3638766547884869,0.5070149533398269,0.39966122942632193,1

Maribavir, indicated for CMV infection that is refractory to first-line treatments, is a high-cost, limited-distribution specialty medication that requires frequent laboratory monitoring to assess efficacy. To evaluate outcomes of health system specialty pharmacy (HSSP) management of maribavir including waste and cost avoidance, medication access, and pharmacist interventions during treatment. This study was a single-center, retrospective cohort analysis of patients prescribed maribavir from April 1, 2022, to August 1, 2024. Included patients were prescribed maribavir for posttransplant CMV infection/disease that was refractory to treatment with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir, or foscarnet. Outcomes included the number of dispenses that were reduced by pharmacist interventions that led to medication waste avoidance and the cost avoidance of these interventions, time to medication access, and the number of pharmacist interventions recommending laboratory tests or medication discontinuation during treatment. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. To estimate costs avoided by pharmacy and payer, cost avoidance was calculated by multiplying the 14-day supply of maribavir that was not dispensed during the final treatment course because of pharmacist intervention by the average wholesale price (AWP), AWP minus 20% (AWP-20%), and wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). Included patients (N = 33) were predominately male (64%) with a median age of 62 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 50-66 years). Five patients were required to repeat treatment with maribavir multiple times because of CMV reactivation totaling 41 unique instances of maribavir use. The most common transplant type was kidney (n = 11), and all patients were donor CMV positive (n = 33). 29 patients were able to fill with the institution's HSSP with 36 instances of maribavir use and 113 fills of maribavir. Of these 36 instances, 12 (33%) had the final dispense of the treatment course reduced because of pharmacist intervention, amounting to a cost avoidance range of $143,421 (AWP-20%) to $179,276 (AWP). Maribavir insurance prior approval (PA) was required for 31 (76%) instances of medication use, with median PAs occurring the same day as referral (IQR = 0-2). Of the 41 instances of maribavir use, 8 (20%) required an intervention from the pharmacist recommending CMV laboratory testing be completed. Pharmacists successfully obtained timely insurance PAs for maribavir. During treatment, pharmacists reduced unnecessary fills, resulting in large cost and waste avoidance. Future research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of interventions by specialty pharmacists on maribavir patient outcomes.",0.5680788867019382,0.5680788867019382,0.09187237738267807,0.09187237738267807,0.47069511340866854,0.47069511340866854,0.28619320833415623,0.28619320833415623,0.43707357351035436,0.41509643110915423,0.46558201450627434,0.4514916362027586,0.4620594199303954,1

Specifically, the research investigated the economic impact on the Italian National Health System due to the increased clinical complexity and multimorbidity among patients with these conditions. A predictive model was developed to estimate the costs of managing patients with T2D, CKD, and HF, either as standalone diseases or in combination. Epidemiological data were derived from real-world data, analyzing a sample corresponding to approximately 10% of the Italian population. The model stratified patients into seven groups based on disease combinations and estimated direct healthcare costs, resulting from hospitalizations, medications, and outpatient services. Scenario analyses were performed to forecast costs based on the expected progression of single diseases to multimorbid conditions. The analysis estimated a total annual healthcare expenditure of approximately €18.7 billion for the 5.77 million Italian patients with at least one of these diseases. Patients with T2D, CKD, and HF had an average yearly cost of €2,002, €4,322, and €5,061, respectively, with multimorbid patients incurring significantly higher costs. Scenario analyses predicted a potential increase in total healthcare expenditures to €19.5 billion, with an additional burden of €775 million. The findings underscore the substantial economic burden of T2D, CKD, and HF, exacerbated by multimorbidity. The results highlight the need for early diagnosis, targeted prevention, and optimized treatment strategies to mitigate rising healthcare costs and improve patients' outcomes.",0.4104788384113981,0.4104788384113981,0.12717648075218224,0.12717648075218224,0.4055746346423295,0.4055746346423295,0.43538359716395253,0.43538359716395253,0.3870059743303544,0.37372545441451077,0.40938735287709155,0.4054114293707349,0.4083933720005024,1
PMC12502344,Economic cost of end-stage renal disease in Africa: a systematic review.,2025,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and irreversible condition that contributes substantially to global morbidity and mortality. In Africa, the burden of CKD is compounded by limited healthcare resources, poverty, and the dual challenge of communicable and non-communicable diseases. The economic impact of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is considerable, yet evidence from the region remains scarce. Methods This systematic review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines, examined the economic burden of ESRD in Africa. Data were extracted on study characteristics, patient populations, cost components, and financing mechanisms. All reported costs were standardized to 2025 USD. Results Eighteen studies, involving 2,634 patients, were included. The majority received haemodialysis (HD) (95.9%), with limited data on peritoneal dialysis (PD) (2.7%) and kidney transplantation (1.4%). Annual HD costs varied widely, from $2,003.48 in Burkina Faso to $41,957.69 in South Africa, with a pooled median of $18,741.00. PD costs, reported in three studies, ranged from $11,161.98 in Egypt to $47,837.05 in South Africa. First-year transplantation costs plus follow-up varied between $33,120.18 in Cameroon and $46,293.59 in Nigeria. Direct medical costs dominated expenditures, with drugs and laboratory investigations representing major cost drivers.

These conditions often co-exist in one individual resulting in frequent hospitalisations and premature deaths. Herein, we provide an updated comprehensive state-of-the-art review, summarising the linkages between heart disease and kidney disease, the mechanisms connecting these conditions, common risk factors, management, implications for health systems, and the impact on patients, particularly in low-resource settings. As experts representing the World Heart Federation (WHF) and International Society of Nephrology (ISN), we highlight areas of opportunity and provide recommendations on improving access to care for the growing numbers of patients with heart and kidney diseases with a focus on low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Conclusion Heart disease and kidney disease are closely interlinked—they share many common risk factors and many common therapeutic approaches, and each modifies the risks and outcomes of the other. Both represent a spectrum of common diseases, impacting millions of people globally. Both diseases are preventable if shared risk factors are diagnosed and treated early. As such, a holistic approach to detecting and managing common risk factors for kidney and heart disease such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity is key at both the public health and the health systems levels. Access to diagnosis and quality care for both is inequitable across the globe. Early diagnosis of kidney and heart disease is increasingly important as newer medications are game-changers, improving short- and long-term outcomes, but these remain out of reach for many because of unaffordability.

PMC12532900,Real-world burden of primary hyperoxaluria with chronic kidney disease in the United States: a retrospective administrative claims analysis.,2025,"Background Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is a family of three rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorders that can result in recurrent kidney stones, progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), and kidney failure. PH prevalence is underestimated due to its varying presentation and lack of awareness; delays in diagnosis can lead to substantial burdens on the healthcare system. Methods This retrospective, observational claims analysis evaluated disease burden and cost of care in patients who had PH, PH with CKD, or CKD alone. Data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters databases and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare Fee-for-Service Limited Data Set were assessed during the study period of January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021. PH prevalence was calculated based on the sample population within each data source. Results The study sample included 326 patients who had PH; applying projection factors to the US population, an estimated 4500 patients had a diagnosis of PH in 2021. Among these patients, 37% were estimated to have PH with CKD (65% of whom had early CKD, 33% had advanced CKD, and 2% had stage reported as unknown). Patients who had CKD alone ( n = 845) were matched with patients who had PH with CKD ( n = 169). Patients who had PH with CKD were significantly more burdened with kidney stones ( p < 0.01) than patients who had CKD alone. Higher rates of pharmacotherapy and medical treatments were observed in patients who had PH with CKD versus patients who had CKD alone. Median semi-annual total all-cause healthcare costs were greater in patients who had PH with CKD than in patients with CKD alone, regardless of CKD stage ($54,154 in patients who had PH with advanced CKD vs. $35,016 in patients with advanced CKD alone; $9,784 in patients who had PH with early CKD vs. $5,572 in patients with early CKD alone). Conclusions CKD stage progression among patients who had PH is associated with increasing all-cause costs, suggesting that early diagnosis and treatment of PH to limit the progression to advanced CKD could represent an opportunity to alleviate not only PH symptoms, but also the healthcare cost burden.

PMC12463892,Evaluating disease burden in chronic kidney disease screening using a micro-simulation model.,2025,"Introduction Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a high prevalence, poor prognosis, and high medical costs, and awareness of the disease is low. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to simulate and analyze the evolution of CKD burden among different groups at high risk of CKD in Shanghai, with or without screening intervention, and provide a quantifiable basis for the selection of screening intervention strategies for CKD. Methods A micro-simulation model was constructed to analyze the evolution of CKD burden using data from CKD screening of the population in the Jing’an and Minhang Districts of Shanghai, China, from January 2015 to December 2020. SAS Statistical Software 9.4 was used to simulate and analyze the evolution of disease burden under different screening intervention strategies. Results By 2033, screening interventions for high-risk groups with hypertension, diabetes, and an age of 65 years and older would be associated with 6,250 fewer patients with end-stage renal disease. Furthermore, the number of patients with end-stage renal disease would be reduced to only 41.64% of the projected number of patients without screening intervention, leading to a general improvement in the quality of life of the population, better quality-adjusted life-years, and a reduction in the economic burden of disease. Discussion The results of this study highlight the importance of combining the concepts of integrated prevention and treatment of chronic diseases to improve screening and intervention of CKD for people with hypertension, diabetes, and those aged 65 years and older, thereby effectively reducing the number of patients with end-stage renal disease, lowering the cost of treatment and intervention, and improving the quality of life of the population. 5 Conclusion According to our results, it is recommended to incorporate the concept of integrated prevention and treatment of chronic diseases and continue to explore the construction of the Shanghai CKD screening and prevention system. It is necessary to strengthen collaboration among institutions within the system, effectively implement the key measures of the three-tier CKD prevention and treatment network, and conduct screening and intervention for CKD in individuals with hypertension, diabetes, and an age of 65 years and older. This approach has the potential to effectively reduce the number of patients with end-stage disease, reduce the cost of treatment and intervention, and improve the quality of life of the population. The single-factor sensitivity analysis results show that the factors affecting the economic burden of CKD are mainly the probability of disease state transition and the cost of disease intervention. In case of a 10% increase or decrease in both, except for the non-intervention group, the change in the probability of disease state transition has a greater impact on the economic burden of disease, whereas the rest are more affected by cost changes. Regarding quality of life, the main factors affecting the annual average QALYs are utility value and probability of disease state transition. When both factors increase or decrease by 10%, changes in utility value have a greater impact on the results. This study had a few limitations. First, we assumed that the distribution of high-risk groups participating in the screening of CKD is consistent with the distribution of the registered residence population in Shanghai, which may have led to certain errors in the simulation results. Second, the disease state transition probability, mortality, and prevalence of population high-risk factors (hypertension, diabetes) for CKD in the research process are from relevant literature reports or meta-analysis results; therefore, the accuracy of their parameters may also lead to simulation errors to a certain extent. Third, we analyzed the risk of disease onset with and without intervention; therefore, compared with the actual situation, it may, to some extent, expand the screening intervention effect. Fourth, this model assumed full participation in the screening but did not consider the impact of changes in population participation in screening interventions on the results. However, the targeted implementation of prevention and control strategies affects the distribution of screening and treatment intervention behaviors among the affected population, thereby influencing the distribution of screening results and the probability of disease state transition. The probability of disease state transition affects the outcome of disease burden in the population.",0.6395552464729094,0.6395552464729094,0.047809263779738674,0.047809263779738674,0.6264813521141575,0.6264813521141575,0.5876918271435636,0.5876918271435636,0.769546301287621,0.7408039243009615,0.6002026675535874,0.5346161807000082,0.5838060458401926,1
PMC12461149,Pathways to translation for nanomedicine in nephrology.,2025,"ABSTRACT Kidney diseases are a substantial worldwide health burden, with high mortality and increasing incidence. Despite their prevalence, substantial gaps remain in the clinic in both diagnostics and therapeutics. Many novel treatments have failed in clinical trials or fallen out of use in the clinic due to side effects and poor efficacy, in large part due to poor therapeutic profiles in the kidney. Nanomedicines have begun to emerge as a potentially promising diagnostic or therapeutic delivery system. Based on their physicochemical properties, such as size, shape, surface chemistry, and so on, some nanotechnologies can target the kidneys. However, as of yet, no kidney-specific nanomedicines have reached clinical translation. While the field of renal nanomedicine is in its early stages and growing, some potential obstacles to translation include poor preclinical models, challenges in manufacturing scale-up, clinical trial design and the cost of translation. Here, we overview the current state of the kidney-targeting nanomedicine field and outline a potential framework for clinical translation. We focus on the paths of US Food and Drug Administration– approved nanomedicines and suggestions from other nanomedicine fields to inform our key considerations for translational success. We also highlight the importance of academic and clinical collaboration with industry and federal regulators. Several investigational technologies are just now at the cusp of scaling towards the clinic and we therefore aim to support this momentum for improving the lives of patients with kidney diseases. Future directions and conclusions The prevalence and morbidity associated with acute and chronic kidney diseases highlight the need for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Kidney-targeting nanomedicines have the potential to improve kidney disease treatment and diagnostics by delivering therapeutics directly to the site of kidney injury. However, nanomedicines face many barriers for entry to the clinic, so it is crucial to address these common problems to ensure kidney-targeting nanomedicines have an optimal impact on patient outcomes. Reviewing the paths of previously successful nanomedicines and recommendations given to other fields, we identified several essential elements to improve when translating from bench to bedside, illustrating the proposed translational timeline (Fig. 3 ) and highlighting future research avenues to be explored (Table 2 ). By refining preclinical models, understanding nanoparticle pharmacokinetics and tailoring clinical trial designs, kidney-targeting nanomedicines hold great promise for revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases. We are confident that a streamlined, team-based, patient-focused approach to clinical development of kidney-targeted nanomedicines will increase the likelihood of success and ultimately facilitate more rapid translation to the clinic. Translational efforts will not only work to support individual success, but will also open the door for more kidney-targeting nanomedicine products in the future.

Methods We retrieved the homepage information of 593,792 hospitalized patients with gout from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2021 through the Guangdong Provincial Medical Record Homepage System and analyzed the prevalence of single comorbidity and multiple comorbidities and economic burden. Results 1. The prevalence of gout was 1.31%. The prevalence in males was five times higher than that of females. 2. The prevalence of hypertension was highest (42.59%) in gout patients; the following were type 2 diabetes (18.03%) and hyperlipidemia (17.98%). 3. The prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, chronic heart failure, coronary heart disease, and chronic kidney disease were more prevalent in women ( P < 0.05). 4. Gout-hypertension-type 2 diabetes had the highest prevalence in all gout patients. The prevalence of multiple complications showed an increasing trend. 5. Gout- hypertension-type 2 diabetes had the highest prevalence in male and female patients ( P < 0.001). Except for the prevalence of gout-hypertension-obesity, gout-obesity-type 2 diabetes and gout-hypertension-obesity-type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of other multiple comorbidities was significantly higher in women ( P < 0.001). 6. The average annual cost of hospitalized patients with acute gouty arthritis ranged from RMB 5994.45 to RMB 6709.66, which decreased in women. From 2020 to 2021, the average cost of men with acute gout was much higher than that of women. From 2018 to 2021, the average cost was highest in patients among 40–69 years old. Conclusions 1.

PMC12559013,Economic Burden and Clinical Epidemiology of Dialysis: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Chronic Kidney Disease Patients.,2025,"Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a rising global health burden, with millions requiring dialysis as a form of kidney replacement therapy. In low- and middle-income countries such as Pakistan, dialysis care is partially subsidised, but patients often face substantial out-of-pocket (OOP) costs, creating financial strain. Methods: This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted at a dialysis unit of a secondary care hospital in Pakistan. All patients on maintenance hemodialysis were invited to participate; the response rate was 80.8%. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and review of medical records. Demographic, clinical, and economic variables were captured, including comorbidities, dialysis duration and frequency, use of supportive therapies, and direct, indirect medical and non-medical costs in 2024 US dollars (USD). Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results: The cohort comprised 42 patients, 66.7% of whom were male (n = 28), with a mean CKD duration of 6.8 ± 5.2 years and a median dialysis duration of 1.0 year (IQR, 0.6-2.0 years). The mean age of the cohort was 58.3 ± 13.7 years (range, 25-83 years). Most (95.2%) were on twice-weekly hemodialysis. Despite full coverage of dialysis sessions through the Sehat Sahulat Programme, all patients incurred recurrent OOP costs. The median monthly “basic bundle” (consultation, labs, medications) cost was Pakistani rupees (PKR) 22,100 (approximately USD $78.40), equivalent to a mean annual cost of PKR 316,057 ± 149,030 (USD $1,121.55 ± $528.92). Additional costs included erythropoietin (85.7%, median PKR 7,600/month), blood transfusions (42.9%, median PKR 12,000/year), hospitalisations (38.1%, median PKR 190,000/year), transport (median PKR 4,800/month), and special diet (57.1%, median PKR 10,000/month). Using cumulative burden thresholds, 28.6% of households exceeded 100% of their monthly household income for expanded costs (4.8% for basic costs). Conclusion: Dialysis patients in Pakistan carry a heavy dual burden of disease and economic hardship. While sessional dialysis is publicly financed, significant ancillary costs remain, often exceeding household income and driving catastrophic health spending. Policies expanding financial protection to include medications, laboratory testing, nutrition, and transport are urgently needed. Conclusions This study highlights the dual burden of chronic kidney disease in Pakistan, marked by a high prevalence of comorbidities, alongside significant out-of-pocket expenditures despite partial state coverage of dialysis sessions. Patients faced substantial residual costs for medications, investigations, transport, and dietary needs, often exceeding household income and leading to asset sales and debt. These findings underscore the urgent need for policy interventions that move beyond dialysis session financing to include essential supportive therapies, nutritional care, and transport assistance. Strengthening financial protection within programs like the Sehat Sahulat Programme, while exploring cost-effective strategies such as peritoneal dialysis expansion and monitored incremental hemodialysis, could mitigate both clinical risks and economic hardship.

Acthar® Gel, a US Food and Drug Administration–approved treatment option, may offer an alternative for managing refractory proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome (NS) due to iMN where multiple treatments have failed. Objective: The cost per response of Acthar® Gel vs standard of care (SoC; cyclophosphamide or rituximab) for treatment of proteinuria in NS due to iMN was evaluated among adults who had failed multiple treatments from a US payer perspective over a 1- to 3-year horizon. Methods: A probabilistic, cohort-level state-transition model simulated patient progression through various health states using 6-month cycles. Patients began in a relapse phase and received either Acthar® Gel or SoC. Transition probabilities determined whether patients achieved a response, experienced no response, progressed to renal failure, or remained in relapse. Responders could potentially maintain their response or relapse, while nonresponders risked renal failure, with potential mortality from any state. Clinical, healthcare resource utilization, and cost data were derived from published literature. Drug prices were based on wholesale acquisition costs. Results: Over 1 year, Acthar® Gel showed a lower cost per response ( 377 185 ) t h a n c y c l o p h o s p h a m i d e ( 551 687) and rituximab ($741 373). This cost advantage of Acthar® Gel was maintained over 2 and 3 years. Acthar® Gel had higher drug acquisition costs than cyclophosphamide and rituximab but resulted in lower overall medical costs and higher response rates within 1 year, without additional treatment-related costs. Over 2 and 3 years, Acthar® Gel had a lower overall cost of care and higher response rates than SoC, establishing it as a dominant treatment option. Conclusions: Based on current model assumptions and clinical inputs, Acthar® Gel may potentially be a cost-effective and value-based treatment strategy vs unapproved SoCs for adults with refractory proteinuria in NS due to iMN, particularly for those who have not responded to conventional therapies over a 1- to 3-year period within a US payer context. These results may inform clinical and payer decision-making in cases when other standard therapies fail to achieve desired outcomes for a specific population. CONCLUSIONS This analysis indicates that, based on the current assumptions and clinical inputs, Acthar® Gel has the potential to be a cost-effective and value-based treatment strategy compared with unapproved SoCs for adults with refractory proteinuria in NS due to iMN, particularly for those who have failed multiple treatments. While the conclusions of this economic analysis are based on the available model inputs, they provide valuable preliminary insights and help generate hypotheses for further research, particularly given the limited data in this population. These results may inform clinical and payer decision-making in cases where standard therapies fail to achieve desired outcomes for a specific population. Additional research is needed to assess the long-term benefits of Acthar® Gel. Future research, including head-to-head trials or registry studies, is needed to confirm the durability of response and to fully characterize the safety profile.",0.810189870940541,0.810189870940541,0.6842394914708486,0.6842394914708486,0.606744454996259,0.606744454996259,0.8440017116433075,0.8440017116433075,0.7443459315456631,0.6585496766033201,0.7033864212497176,1.0,0.7775398159372882,1
PMC12519640,Navigating the Challenge: Selecting the Optimal Assay for Serum Albumin Measurement.,2025,"Background Photometric techniques are the most common methods for measuring serum albumin, where albumin binds with an organic dye to form a complex. These methods are popular due to their simplicity, automation potential, speed, and cost-effectiveness, with bromocresol green (BCG) and bromocresol purple (BCP) being the most frequently used dyes. Case presentation A 2-year-old boy presented with facial swelling, starting around the eyes in the morning and gradually spreading to the face, improving by evening, and accompanied by reduced urine output. He was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome and treated with a high-calorie, high-protein diet, oral prednisolone, furosemide, and intravenous albumin. Despite treatment, his local laboratory’s serum albumin level remained consistently low. However, tests from a private lab showed levels higher than the state lab. The nephrology team was informed of this discrepancy and chose to rely on the private lab’s results. Conclusion A comparison study between BCP and BCG methods found a good correlation overall, but Bland-Altman analysis revealed that BCG had a significant positive bias compared to BCP, explaining the lab discrepancies. The study underscored the importance of clinician awareness of different serum albumin measurement methods, noting that BCP is more specific and does not overestimate albumin in kidney disease patients like BCG does.

PMC12448927,Drivers of hospital costs in ANCA-associated vasculitis patients with long-term follow-up-a real-world cost analysis.,2025,"ABSTRACT Background Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a potentially life-threatening, systemic autoimmune disease with a high risk for relapse and treatment-related toxicity, making AAV a high-costs illness. This study aimed to identify clinical insights for clinicians on considering this costs burden. Methods We conducted a detailed, retrospective, single-centre, activity-based cost-analysis and identified clinical variables associated with increased costs. We analysed real-world costs incurred by the hospital between January 2018 and December 2019, omitting the outpatient pharmacy expenditures. Our cohort included both incident and prevalent AAV patients with at least 6 months of follow-up since diagnosis, indicating survival beyond initial diagnosis. Results For 180 AAV patients with a median follow-up of 1.8 years the average hospital costs incurred amounted to €9887 per patient year, with inpatient care being the primary cost driver (32%). Merely 15% of costs were attributable to patients experiencing relapse ( N = 14/180, 8%). More importantly, 71% of costs were attributable to patients experiencing infections ( N = 77/180, 43%). Likewise, 60% of costs were attributable to patients with multi-comorbidity ( N = 65/180, 36%). Infections and multi-comorbidity were both strongly associated with corticosteroid (CS) use. Regression and sensitivity analyses suggest that a reduction of infections, comorbidities and maintenance treatment with CS will reduce hospital costs. Conclusion This real-world cost analysis demonstrates that the burden of infections and comorbidities, both related to CS use, is higher than that of relapses on hospital costs in AAV patients. Thus, this study implicates clinicians considering hospital costs should focus on reducing CS and achieving CS-free remission to prevent infections and comorbidities. Conclusion This real-world cost analysis demonstrates that the burden of infections and comorbidities, both related to CS use, is higher than that of relapses on hospital costs in AAV patients.

PMC12522466,"A pragmatic, randomised, open-label, multi-centre UK registry-facilitated trial evaluating the effect of high-dose cholecalciferol on mortality in patients on dialysis: the SIMPLIFIED trial.",2025,"Background Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) and is a strong predictor of death from cardiovascular disease, infections and cancer. Currently only 68% of patients in the UK survive 3 years or more on dialysis. Vitamin D replacement typically utilises activated (1α-hydroxylated) vitamin D compounds allowing for impaired renal activation. However, this approach increases blood calcium concentrations and may paradoxically accelerate vitamin D catabolism. Contemporary treatment guidelines recommend replacement with inactive (unhydroxylated) vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol), instead relying on autocrine and paracrine vitamin D activation in target tissues. However, the impact of this approach on clinical outcomes has not yet been tested in adequately powered trials. Methods The SIMPLIFIED (Survival Improvement with Cholecalciferol in Patients on Dialysis) trial will test whether supplementation with high-dose cholecalciferol improves survival. Adult dialysis patients will be recruited from one of 72 UK renal centres, by local clinicians and research nurses, and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to high-dose open-label cholecalciferol or standard care, stratified by site. Trial outcomes will be captured using existing data sources including Office of National Statistics (ONS) for deaths and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint of the trial is all-cause mortality. Key secondary endpoints include survival free from cardiovascular events, infections and cancers, and quality of life and cost-effectiveness measures utilising the Eq5D tool. Severe adverse event line listings will be generated from HES data for safety reporting. In this superiority trial, it is anticipated that approximately 4200 patients in total will need to be enrolled to observe 2200 deaths over a period of about 7 years, which will yield 90% power to demonstrate a hazard ratio of 0.87. Discussion Outcomes for patients on dialysis remain very poor. The pragmatic design of this study leveraging routinely collected data streamlines trial conduct, reducing burden on patients and local site study staff. Furthermore, since cholecalciferol is a low-cost and easy to administer intervention, evidence of benefit could be readily incorporated into dialysis care across healthcare systems globally.

PMC12542903,"Resource Use and Cost Associated With Cardiovascular, Renal, Bone, and Neuropsychiatric Comorbidities in People With HIV in Spain.",2025,"Background: Antiretroviral therapies (ART) have significantly improved the life expectancy of people with HIV (PLWH). However, chronic immune activation and some ART regimens may increase the prevalence of non-HIV comorbidities, such as cardiovascular, renal, bone, and neuropsychiatric conditions. These comorbidities increase healthcare resource utilization and costs for the Spanish National Health System (NHS), yet data on their economic impact remain scarce. Objective: To estimate the healthcare resource use and costs associated with cardiovascular, renal, bone, and neuropsychiatric comorbidities in PLWH from the Spanish NHS perspective and to simulate the financial impact of a potential prevalence increase due to ART toxicity. Methods: An Excel-based model was used to compare a current scenario using national epidemiological data and an alternative scenario with increased comorbidity prevalence due to ART toxicity. Two cohorts were analyzed: PLWH diagnosed for less than 10 years and those diagnosed for 10 years or more. Epidemiological and healthcare utilization data were collected from the literature and validated by an expert panel. Direct healthcare costs, including hospitalizations, tests, medical visits, and emergency care, were estimated and discounted at a 3% annual discount rate. Results: In 2024, 139 390 PLWH would be living in Spain, with 17 046 having cardiovascular, 7752 renal, 17 700 bone, and 16 207 neuropsychiatric comorbidities, predominantly affecting patients diagnosed for at least 10 years. By 2034, these figures will rise to 33 555, 15 391, 33 950, and 27 388, respectively, with increases observed in both cohorts. Estimated 2024 healthcare costs were €83 million, €48 million, €55 million, and €97 million for cardiovascular, renal, bone, and neuropsychiatric comorbidities, respectively. The alternative scenario with increased comorbidities prevalence projected an additional €900 million to €1400 million. Discussion: The projected increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular, renal, bone, and neuropsychiatric comorbidities among PLWH represents a significant challenge for the Spanish NHS, primarily driven by long-term use of specific ART regimes associated with higher toxicity profiles. Conclusion: Non-HIV comorbidities pose a growing economic challenge. Selecting lower-toxicity ART regimens and preventive strategies will be crucial to mitigating financial impact. CONCLUSION This study estimated the costs associated with cardiovascular, renal, bone, and neuropsychiatric comorbidities in PLWH in Spain over a 10-year period (2024-2034). The findings highlight that even a moderate increase in the prevalence of these comorbidities (potentially due to the toxicity of specific antiretroviral regimens) can have significant impacts on the Spanish National Health System. In this context, during the next years it will be essential to implement strategies aimed at minimizing the increase in comorbidities caused by treatment toxicity in PLWH.

PMC12233814,Are Your kidneys ok? Detect early to protect kidney health.,2025,"Abstract Early identification of kidney disease can protect kidney health, prevent kidney disease progression and related complications, reduce cardiovascular disease risk, and decrease mortality. We must ask “ Are your kidneys ok ?” using serum creatinine to estimate kidney function and urine albumin to assess for kidney and endothelial damage. Evaluation for causes and risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) includes testing for diabetes and measurement of blood pressure and body mass index. On this World Kidney Day, we emphasize that case-finding in high-risk populations or even population level screening can decrease the burden of kidney disease globally. Early-stage CKD is asymptomatic, simple to test for, and recent paradigm shifting CKD treatments such as sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors dramatically improve outcomes and favor the cost-benefit analysis for screening or case-finding programs. Despite this, numerous barriers exist, including resource allocation, healthcare funding, healthcare infrastructure, and awareness of kidney disease among healthcare professionals and the general population. Coordinated efforts by major kidney non-governmental organizations to prioritise the kidney health agenda for governments and align early detection efforts with other current programs will maximise efficiency. Conclusion: A Call to Action We call on all healthcare professionals to check the kidney health of their patients at risk of kidney disease. In tandem, we must work with public health organizations to improve the general population’s perceived risk of kidney disease and empower people at risk to seek kidney health checks. To ensure this change can be delivered, we must work with healthcare systems, governments, and the WHO to prioritize kidney disease and create effective and efficient early detection programs for kidney disease. Only then will the paradigm-shifting benefits of lifestyle change and pharmacologic treatments translate to better kidney and overall health for people all around the world.",0.35887358462181773,0.35887358462181773,0.4443869658560343,0.4443869658560343,0.6627120616850151,0.6627120616850151,0.8727006557640059,0.8727006557640059,0.9299286315411902,1.0,0.6178164907153643,0.7878977688431391,0.660336810247308,1
PMC12418889,Use of surrogate endpoints in health technology assessment and reimbursement of treatments for the management of chronic kidney disease.,2025,"Summary The judicious use of surrogate endpoints as substitutes for patient relevant target outcomes can substantially reduce the size and duration of clinical trials, thereby driving down research and development costs and driving faster patient access to innovative therapies. Whilst increasingly used by regulators over the last two decades, health technology assessment (HTA) agencies and payers have been more sceptical in acceptance of surrogates in their reimbursement decisions. Central to acceptance is scientific validation and demonstration of the association in the treatment effect on the surrogate endpoint and target outcome. This review summarises the validity and utility of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) slope as a ‘first in class’ surrogate with robust evidence of a strong treatment effect association (i.e., R 2 trial of 97%) with clinically meaningful kidney target outcomes including dialysis and kidney transplantation. Given the likely continued challenges in the use of surrogate endpoints in future healthcare policy making, we conclude this review with the opportunities for stakeholders–healthcare industry, regulators and payers, clinicians and trialists, and patients and the public–to leverage the future appropriate use of surrogates. Funding None declared. Conclusion The appropriate use of validated surrogate endpoints can significantly reduce clinical trial costs and accelerate patient access to new therapies. Despite widespread use by regulators, HTA agencies and payers remain cautious in adopting surrogates for reimbursement decisions. Scientific validation, demonstrated by strong treatment effect associations, is essential for the acceptance of surrogates in clinical practice.

PMC12476764,Cystatin C-based equations: Enhancing accuracy in kidney function tests for type 2 diabetes.,2025,"Approximately 30%-40% of individuals with diabetes develop chronic kidney disease during their lifetime, and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have a high risk of developing and progressing to this condition. The two comorbidities represent a lethal combination that exacerbates both diseases. It is crucial to measure the glomerular filtration rate and to monitor and assess the renal functionality of these patients. Serum creatinine, the traditional marker of kidney assessment, has been shown to be susceptible to too many variables that can significantly alter the final estimated glomerular filtration rate outcome. Cystatin C-based formulas appear to have reasonable accuracy in this population and help to ensure better tailored therapy and renal assessment. The purpose of this editorial was to provide an examination of the advantage of using cystatin C as a valid marker for determining estimated glomerular filtration rate, free from any interfering factors, allowing a more accurate assessment of renal function. CONCLUSION Determining early deterioration of eGFR and associated factors would help clinicians to take appropriate measures to improve kidney function, especially among certain categories of frail patients such as patients with diabetes and the elderly. The evaluation of eGFR using cystatin C allows us to improve the accuracy of the evaluation, overcoming the distortions traditionally linked to muscle mass. Specific recommendations should include: (1) Routine cystatin C-based eGFR assessment in high-risk populations, such as patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease and the elderly, in whom creatinine-based equations may be less reliable; (2) Integration of cystatin C into clinical decision-making to optimize risk stratification, particularly for guiding treatment modifications in DKD and CKD patients; (3) Use of the combined creatinine-cystatin C equation in routine nephrology practice, as recommended by the KDIGO guidelines, to improve GFR estimation accuracy and reduce misclassification of kidney disease severity; and (4) Further research to establish cost-effective models for implementing cystatin C testing in routine practice, ensuring accessibility even in resource-limited settings. By refining the approach to kidney function assessment, particularly in vulnerable populations, the clinical utility of cystatin C-based equations can be maximized to improve patient outcomes and enhance precision medicine in nephrology. To increase the validity and reliability of the results and make them clinically useful, the study of the relationship between cystatin C and the diagnosis of DKD requires a large sample, a randomized and blinded research design, the use of a uniform gold standard, and a uniform classification of diseases. Further research is needed to comprehensively evaluate the clinical effectiveness of cystatin C-based equations by comparing their predictive value for the development of CKD, cardiovascular events, and mortality in different populations. Research should also focus on formulating various adjustment factors encompassing all non-GFR determinants of cystatin C in different patient populations, carefully evaluating the temporal variations of cystatin C relative to creatinine with the progression of kidney disease and the implementation of therapeutic interventions and comprehensively investigating the cost-effectiveness of cystatin C measurement in standard clinical practice considering its advantages over creatinine-based assessments.",0.7659889145062431,0.7659889145062431,0.0,0.0,0.439847525545604,0.439847525545604,0.43883432822468277,0.43883432822468277,0.786095230177206,0.742436520791711,0.5540533286637486,0.5767228233287375,0.5597207023299958,1

PMC12579019,Risk of Progression and Costs of Care for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease.,2025,"Introduction Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression is associated with a significant incremental economic burden. Previous work has demonstrated high accuracy of the laboratory-based machine learning model, Klinrisk, in predicting the risk of CKD progression. We sought to use the Klinrisk model to evaluate the association of risk of CKD progression with healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs of care in adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD. Methods This retrospective observational study included 413,177 eligible patients from Optum’s electronic health records database (1/1/2007–9/30/2022). Patients were classified into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups based on their 2-year risk of CKD progression as predicted by the Klinrisk model. All-cause HRU and medical costs during the 1 year after CKD were estimated for each group. Results Of the 413,177 patients included, 110,399 (26.7%) were classified as low-risk of CKD progression, 253,188 (61.3%) as medium-risk, and 49,590 (12.0%) as high-risk. The observed risk of CKD progression at 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years was 18.6%, 36.5%, and 54.1% for high-risk patients, 3.7%, 11.7%, and 26.4% for medium-risk patients, and 1.5%, 5.7%, and 15.8% for low-risk patients, which were similar to the predicted risks of CKD progression. High-risk patients had higher HRU and more than 2–3 times higher costs than lower-risk patients. Inpatient costs were the major cost driver for high-risk patients. Conclusions The Klinrisk model accurately identified patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD requiring the most healthcare resources. Such tools can support the identification and targeting of high-risk patients for interventions that may lead to a more cost-effective model of care.

Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who died between 2017 and 2019, who had either a primary or secondary diagnosis of advanced dementia, severe liver disease, as well as heart, kidney or respiratory failure in the last five years of their lives. Data was extracted from administrative databases of a regional health system in Singapore. We classified patients into subgroups with distinctly different five-year healthcare expenditure trajectories, using longitudinal k-means clustering. Factors associated with membership in each subgroup were then identified through multinomial modelling. Results Among 7,154 decedents, three trajectories of consistently low cost (LC, n = 5,756), moderately high cost near death (MC, n = 1,283) and escalating cost near death (EC, n = 115) were identified. Patients with MC often had concurrent end-stage organ diseases and chronic conditions, while patients with EC were younger and often had respiratory failure.

Detect early to protect kidney health.,2025,"Early identification of kidney disease can protect kidney health, prevent kidney disease progression and related complications, reduce cardiovascular disease risk, and decrease mortality. We must ask “Are your kidneys ok?” using serum creatinine to estimate kidney function and urine albumin to assess for kidney and endothelial damage. Evaluation for causes and risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) includes testing for diabetes and measurement of blood pressure and body mass index. This World Kidney Day we assert that case finding in high-risk populations, or even population-level screening, can decrease the burden of kidney disease globally. Early stage CKD is asymptomatic, simple to test for and recent paradigm-shifting CKD treatments such as sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors dramatically improve outcomes and favor the cost–benefit analysis for screening or case-finding programs.

PMC12507110,Optimizing α-galactosidase A enzyme cutoff for Fabry disease screening in chronic kidney disease patients: a single-center reassessment of diagnostic yield and cost-effectiveness.,2025,"Abstract Fabry disease has been increasingly recognized in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). While dried blood spot (DBS) testing for α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity is a common screening method, the optimal cutoff value for enzyme activity in this population remains uncertain. We retrospectively analyzed data from a Fabry disease screening program conducted between October 1, 2018, and September 31, 2023, at Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Male patients with CKD or ESKD underwent DBS α-Gal A enzyme activity testing. Patients with enzyme activity <2.0 μmol/L/hr were referred for confirmatory genetic testing. We assessed the diagnostic yield, baseline characteristics of true positive, false positive, and true negative cases, and performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify the optimal diagnostic threshold. Among 1,654 screened patients, 35 had enzyme activity <2.0 μmol/L/hr, of whom 6 (0.36%) were genetically confirmed as having Fabry disease. Broadening the screening threshold from 1.2 to 2.0 μmol/L/hr enabled the identification of two additional cases. ROC analysis identified an optimal cutoff value of 1.96 μmol/L/hr (AUROC 0.996, 95%CI: 0.991–1.000), yielding a sensitivity of 98.3% (95CI%: 0.9769–0.9891) and specificity of 100% (95%CI:1-1). Patients with false-positive results had significantly lower leukocyte counts than true-positive cases. The incremental cost to detect two additional Fabry patients was $8,010 USD, representing acceptable cost-effectiveness under Taiwan’s healthcare framework. Expanding α-Gal A enzyme activity cutoff value from 1.2 to 2.0 μmol/L/hr improved the diagnostic performance of Fabry disease screening in CKD patients and proved to be cost-effective. Conclusion Based on our study, we propose raising the cutoff value of α-Gal A enzyme activity from 1.2 to 2.0 μmol/L/hr in patients with CKD. This revised threshold demonstrated favorable predictive performance and acceptable cost-effectiveness within the context of Taiwan’s healthcare system.

PMC12404205,Early Diagnosis and Timely Terlipressin in Hepatorenal Syndrome Improves Projected Outcomes and Lowers Cost.,2025,"Introduction Terlipressin is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for adults with hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI) with rapid reduction in kidney function. Treatment with terlipressin, particularly in patients with lower serum creatinine (SCr) at diagnosis, improves outcomes. Despite evidence suggesting that treating HRS-AKI at lower SCr thresholds may improve clinical outcomes, the impact on healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and medical costs of an earlier intervention strategy remains unquantified. This model‐based analysis was conducted from a United States hospital perspective to project the clinical and economic impact of early HRS-AKI diagnosis and treatment with terlipressin among adults. Methods A decision-analytic model compared two SCr level-based scenarios and projected the outcomes for both scenarios. For current clinical practice, patient distribution was based on the CONFIRM trial (SCr <3 mg/dL: 45% and ≥3 to <5 mg/dL: 55%). For early diagnosis and treatment, distribution was based on the HRS medical chart review study (<3 mg/dL: 85% and ≥3 to <5 mg/dL: 15%). Terlipressin HRS reversal rate for the on-label population (SCr <5 mg/dL and acute-on-chronic liver failure grade 0–2) was 52.2% for SCr <3 mg/dL and 33.3% for SCr ≥3 to <5 mg/dL. An annual HRS incidence of 50,000 was assumed. Results Based on the modeled projections, early diagnosis and treatment with terlipressin versus current practice yielded an additional 3040 HRS reversals and consequently led to a reduction in hospital days and intensive care unit days. Early intervention resulted in 960 fewer patients requiring renal replacement therapy during hospitalization and 1200 more patients with 90-day transplant-free survival. Early intervention is projected to save $11,504 per patient, with total national savings of $460.2 million annually. Conclusion Based on the modeled projections using data from clinical trial, earlier HRS diagnosis and treatment with terlipressin may improve clinical outcomes, reduce HCRU, and save costs versus current clinical practice.

PMC12198875,Cost-effectiveness of treatment with finerenone in mild to advanced stage chronic kidney disease patients with type 2 diabetes from a societal perspective.,2025,"ABSTRACT Introduction One in three patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) suffers from any stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD), a chronic illness associated with a high global burden that impacts not only the healthcare system but also societal costs. Addition of finerenone to the standard of care (SoC) for patients with advanced CKD and T2D has been shown to be cost-effective by reducing healthcare and societal costs. This analysis explores the cost-effectiveness of finerenone in patients with CKD (stages 1–4 with albuminuria) associated with T2D from a societal perspective, as broader societal costs are a crucial consideration in managing chronic illnesses. Research design and methods The validated FINE-CKD model was populated with data from the pooled FIDELITY analysis (ie, a patient population with early-to-late stage CKD associated with T2D) to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the addition of finerenone to SoC compared with SoC alone, from a Dutch societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of parameter uncertainty on the robustness of the model. Results Our analysis shows that by adding finerenone to SoC, patients with mild to severe stage CKD and T2D gain 0.14 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with SoC alone, mainly due to a reduction in renal and cardiovascular events. The societal costs of these events are considerable (ie, €8481 and €9799 per patient over a lifetime in the finerenone and SoC arm, respectively), showing the relevance of a societal perspective in chronic diseases. Overall, finerenone leads to savings of €2713 per patient over a lifetime. Therefore, the addition of finerenone to SoC emerges as the dominant treatment option when compared with SoC alone. The sensitivity analysis shows that finerenone has a 62.3% chance to be dominant and an 83.8% chance to be cost-effective, considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20 000/QALY. Conclusions This study highlights the burden that chronic diseases impose on healthcare systems and society, emphasising the relevance of incorporating a societal perspective in cost-effectiveness analyses. The analysis estimates that adding finerenone to SoC treatment for patients with mild to advanced CKD associated with is cost-effective from a healthcare and societal perspective.

PMC12574939,Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs) in Chronic Kidney Disease and Cancer-Related Anemia: A Narrative Review of Literature,,"Anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cancer is conventionally managed with packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions or erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) like epoetin alfa; however, transfusions are limited by complications such as alloimmunization and infection risk, which has led to ESAs becoming the preferred standard of care. Additional therapy may include iron supplementation, which potentially causes complications such as iron overload and infection risks in respective patient populations. The introduction of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) in 1989 improved anemia management but also raised concerns about adverse cardiovascular outcomes in many studies. Current guidelines promote careful ESA use to balance benefits and risks, while alternatives like hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) show promise in reducing such adverse effects. This review explores ESA trends, challenges, and emerging therapies for anemia in CKD and cancer patients and their implications in clinical use. The literature search for this narrative review was conducted on PubMed in January 2025. The search was restricted to articles published between January 2020 and January 2025, focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), narrative reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. The initial PubMed search yielded 454 articles, which were subsequently screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in a final selection of 58 publications that satisfied the eligibility requirements. Overall, evidence from these studies suggests that ESAs are considerably beneficial in correcting anemia and lowering the need for blood transfusions in adult patients with CKD. However, concerns about adverse cardiovascular outcomes and their effects on optimal hemoglobin targets have indicated the need to shift treatment approaches. These articles have also suggested recent developments, including the advent of HIF-PHIs and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, which have been shown to offer safer and therapeutically promising alternatives in anemia of CKD and cancer-related anemia. Tailored approaches that take patient-specific factors into account are necessary for optimizing outcomes, suggesting that further research is required to evaluate the efficacy and risks of these novel treatments within clinical settings. The narrative review has summarized the benefits and drawbacks of ESAs as a widely used treatment for anemia of CKD and cancer-related anemia. Studies identified in this review have shown that ESAs are linked to increased risks of adverse cardiovascular events, tumor progression in cancers, and higher mortality rates. The emerging alternative of HIF-PHIs shows promise in mitigating these adverse risks with a similar treatment efficacy to ESAs. However, there is still a lack of long-term safety data on these treatment options, and future research should focus on determining this risk profile as well as potential dosing strategies to potentially guide the use of HIF-PHIs in future clinical practice as a novel therapeutic alternative for anemia of CKD and cancer-related anemia. Conclusions This narrative review highlights that the use of ESAs in CKD-related anemia improves QoL and reduces transfusion needs but is consistently associated with increased cardiovascular risk, higher mortality, and, in the oncology setting, tumor progression at higher doses. Evidence from recent studies also suggests that targeting higher hemoglobin thresholds provides no additional benefit and may worsen outcomes, underscoring the need for cautious use and individualized dosing. These findings align with current KDIGO recommendations, which advocate conservative hemoglobin targets and emphasize balancing benefits with risks when prescribing ESAs. Emerging alternatives, particularly HIF-PHIs, demonstrate comparable efficacy with added advantages in iron metabolism, oral administration, and patient adherence, although long-term safety data remain limited. Adjunctive therapies such as SGLT-2 inhibitors and novel iron formulations also hold promise as complementary options, offering a broader therapeutic toolkit for anemia management in CKD and cancer populations. Overall, this review emphasizes the importance of additional RCTs and long-term observational studies to evaluate the comparative safety, efficacy, and patient-centered outcomes of ESAs, HIF-PHIs, and adjunctive therapies. By addressing these gaps, future research can better inform individualized, safe, and effective treatment strategies for patients with anemia in CKD and cancer.",1.0,1.0,0.09451613352693214,0.09451613352693214,0.4148489706982753,0.4148489706982753,0.5125063001279482,0.5125063001279482,0.6854831042195277,0.5872410603504146,0.5945355913383815,0.647451130642554,0.6077644761644246,1

But their cost-effectiveness in the USA and China is unclear. Objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of three first-line treatment regimens for untreated aRCC—Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab, Pembrolizumab plus Axitinib, and Sunitinib—from the perspective of national health service systems and indirect healthcare payers in China and the USA, with a focus on intent-to-treat (ITT) populations and International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk stratifications. Design: Decision-tree and Markov models, based on KEYNOTE-426 and CheckMate 214 trials, simulated 5-year disease progression of eligible patients. Methods: The model, constructed using TreeAge Pro 2022 (TreeAge Software, LLC, Williamstown, Massachusetts, USA), incorporated three health states: progression-free survival, progressive disease, and death. Economic parameters included direct medical costs (first-line and second-line treatments, adverse event management, monitoring), quality-adjusted life year (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate model uncertainty. Results: Across favorable-risk, intermediate/poor-risk IMDC subgroups, and the ITT population, Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab sequential Cabozantinib demonstrated the optimal cost-effectiveness in both countries, with ICERs below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. It was associated with lower costs and higher QALYs compared to the other two regimens. Pembrolizumab plus Axitinib sequential Cabozantinib was more cost-effective than sunitinib sequential Cabozantinib in both regions, with ICERs also below WTP thresholds. Conclusion: In China and the USA, Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab is the most cost-effective first-line treatment for aRCC across different IMDC subgroups and the ITT population, followed by Pembrolizumab plus Axitinib, which outperforms sunitinib. These findings can guide clinical decision-making, though their generalizability is limited to China and the USA due to regional differences in drug pricing, payment systems, and market access.

PMC12524814,Medical and Financial Consequences of Using PCSK9 Inhibitors for Managing Hypercholesterolemia in Saudi Arabia: A Historical Cohort Study.,2025,"Background: Managing hypercholesterolemia is essential for reducing health risks and costs. Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are recommended for patients with high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels at risk for cardiovascular disease, especially those on maximum doses of statins and ezetimibe. However, their cost-effectiveness is unclear, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where cardiovascular disease is prevalent. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the costs and outcomes of PCSK9 inhibitors versus statins and ezetimibe. Methods: A multicenter retrospective study reviewed charts of adults (≥18 years) with hypercholesterolemia treated with PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab or alirocumab) for at least 12 months. Outcomes included LDL-C reduction and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, with direct medical costs estimated via micro-costing and adjusted for confounders. Results: The analysis included 118 patients on PCSK9 inhibitors and 304 on statins plus ezetimibe. Mean LDL-C reductions were 1.432 mmol/L [95% CI: 0.964 to 1.899] for PCSK9 inhibitors and 0.644 mmol/L [95% CI: 0.464 to 0.823] for the other group. Cardiovascular-related hospitalizations averaged 0.645 for PCSK9 inhibitors compared to 0.808 for statins plus ezetimibe. The annual cost for PCSK9 inhibitors ranged from USD 4024 [95% CI: 3786.80 to 7947.91] to USD 7559 [95% CI: 7331.35 to 11,509.66]. In 99.13% and 98.78% of bootstrap distributions, PCSK9 inhibitors led to greater LDL-C reductions and fewer hospitalizations. Conclusions: The use of PCSK9 inhibitors for managing hypercholesterolemia was associated with a greater reduction in LDL-C levels and fewer cardiovascular-related hospitalizations. However, the more modest LDL-C reduction compared to clinical trials, combined with the high acquisition cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, underscores the need to provide significant price reductions to improve patient access to these lipid-lowering agents. 5. Conclusions The advent of PCSK9 inhibitors has transformed the management of hypercholesterolemia, especially for patients who do not achieve adequate control through traditional therapies. These agents significantly reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and decrease cardiovascular-related hospitalizations compared to conventional treatments, such as statins and ezetimibe. However, their high cost poses challenges for widespread adoption, raising concerns about the accessibility and sustainability of these therapies. The findings of this study suggest that the reduction in LDL-C may not be as pronounced as previously reported, necessitating careful interpretation of the data and further investigation. Future research should focus on more robust study designs to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors in managing hypercholesterolemia in Saudi Arabia, considering both clinical outcomes and economic implications, and the broader impact on healthcare systems and patient quality of life.",0.6081881327805201,0.6081881327805201,0.08700505695148181,0.08700505695148181,0.30588022490969113,0.30588022490969113,0.4310151933752507,0.4310151933752507,0.41761545058695637,0.337108962681173,0.42905276424862765,0.44951927048115264,0.43416939080675887,1

PMC12471255,Rethinking the Diabetes-Cardiovascular Disease Continuum: Toward Integrated Care.,2025,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are not merely coexisting epidemics but co-evolving manifestations of a shared cardiometabolic continuum. Despite advances in glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure control, residual cardiovascular risk remains high, underscoring the limitations of siloed approaches. In this perspective, we argue for reframing T2D and CVD as interconnected conditions driven by inflammation, adipose tissue dysfunction, and organ crosstalk. Beyond metformin, which remains foundational, several glucose-lowering drug classes are now evaluated not only for glycemic control but also for their cardiovascular and renal impact. Landmark trials and recent meta-analyses confirm that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists improve cardiorenal outcomes. More recently, tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptor agonist, has shown unprecedented efficacy in weight and glucose management, with potential to further transform cardiometabolic risk reduction. Yet enthusiasm for these therapies must be tempered by heterogeneity of response, treatment costs, and inequitable access. Integrated care models, supported by multidisciplinary teams, digital health tools, and value-based reimbursement, are essential to close the gap between trial efficacy and real-world outcomes. Attention to sex, age, ethnicity, and comorbidity profiles is critical to ensure equity, as is the adaptation of strategies to low- and middle-income countries where the burden of cardiometabolic disease is rapidly rising. Ultimately, advancing cardiometabolic medicine requires not only novel therapies but also a unifying framework that integrates biology, behavior, economics, and health systems to deliver the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. 8. Conclusions: Breaking the Silos The long-standing separation of T2D and CVD in clinical care, research, and policy no longer reflects the biological truth. These are not merely comorbidities that happen to co-exist; they are shared expressions of a deeper, systemic dysfunction involving metabolism, inflammation, vascular integrity, and organ crosstalk. Treating them in isolation has yielded incremental gains at best, and persistent residual risk at worst. A new paradigm is needed, one that views cardiometabolic disease as a unified continuum. This demands a transdisciplinary approach: integrating molecular insights with clinical acumen, leveraging digital tools alongside behavioral strategies, and translating scientific advances into policies that prioritize prevention, equity, and long-term well-being. From bench to bedside to community, the call for integration is no longer optional; it is a scientific necessity, a clinical responsibility, and an ethical imperative. As we stand at the intersection of biological complexity and therapeutic possibility, the most impactful innovations may not be in molecules or machines, but in the frameworks we build to connect them, for the whole patient, not just their parts. GLP-1 RAs, SGLT2 inhibitors, and tirzepatide have emerged as cardiometabolic therapies that extend benefits beyond glucose lowering to cardiovascular and renal protection. It is important to acknowledge that enthusiasm for these agents must be tempered by unresolved questions. These include heterogeneity of response, high cost, inequitable access, and the absence of definitive cardiovascular outcomes data for newer agents. Furthermore, integrated care must explicitly account for heterogeneity across sex, age, ethnicity, and comorbidities, recognizing that “one-size-fits-all” approaches risk perpetuating gaps in outcomes. Personalized strategies and equitable implementation are essential to ensure that therapeutic advances translate into benefits for all subgroups. Recognizing these limitations is critical to maintaining scientific rigor while advancing integrated care models. Ultimately, the transformative potential of the novel cardiometabolic therapies will only be realized if health systems evolve to deliver them equitably and in an integrated manner. In this context, predictive tools and molecular profiling will be key to enabling truly personalized therapies, ensuring the right treatment for the right patient at the right time. Although many illustrative programs come from North America and Europe, the principles of integrated and equitable cardiometabolic care are globally relevant, and their successful implementation will require adaptation to diverse health system contexts. Looking ahead, the growing recognition of the cardiometabolic continuum may justify dedicated thematic initiatives and collaborative research agendas, fostering a deeper understanding of shared biological mechanisms and accelerating preventive strategies across populations.",0.5639250296545415,0.5639250296545415,0.0,0.0,0.32821110665953307,0.32821110665953307,0.279803871011073,0.279803871011073,0.6239230470562886,0.655373289557516,0.4259966001589965,0.5063187171564404,0.4460771294083574,1
PMC12515291,A Lived Experience Perspective on Empowering People With Diabetes Through Accessible Point-of-Care Technology in Brazil.,2025,"In Brazil and many other low- and middle-income countries, noncommunicable conditions (NCCs) or noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and dyslipidemia pose significant health and economic challenges. Motivated by our personal experiences living and/or working with NCCs (including one author with diabetes and another with familial hypercholesterolemia), and our collective roles as advocates, researchers, and healthcare professionals, this article highlights the importance of early management strategies and the potential of point-of-care devices in primary healthcare to improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes. Conclusion Integrating POC into PHC is not just advantageous; it is essential for changing the current scenario of undiagnosed, unmonitored, and uncontrolled NCCs. By advocating for early diagnosis and continuous monitoring, we can reduce undiagnosed cases, enhance people's engagement, and build a stronger healthcare system. Collaborative efforts between individuals, healthcare providers, and policymakers are essential to creating a more inclusive and effective healthcare system for managing diabetes and other NCCs. This will ultimately improve health outcomes and alleviate the burden of NCCs in Brazil and other LMICs, helping these countries to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 3.4: “by 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.”",0.4375021487079065,0.4375021487079065,0.0,0.0,0.3701915139901625,0.3701915139901625,0.13503945511583965,0.13503945511583965,0.6335799934026927,0.6893052422355801,0.3904658818024265,0.41939046999465124,0.39769702885048264,1

End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a high-morbidity condition that necessitates high-cost and time-intensive care, the present study aims to investigate the prevalence and economic burden of ESKD among Iranian Hajj pilgrims during the last decade. Methods All demographic information, risk factors, prevalence and Hospital costs of ESKD were extracted from the database and medical records of the Hajj Pilgrimage Medical Centre, Iranian Red Crescent Society through file reading. Also, the multiple logistic regression model was used. Results In total, the study encompassed data on 469,581 Hajj pilgrims. According to the findings, the highest prevalence of ESKD was observed in pilgrims aged 70 years and above. Results show that for the gender variable, the odds of having ESKD among women is 0.523 times that of men, for the creatinine (Cr), for each unit increase in the level of blood creatinine, the odds of having ESKD will be 1.383 times, Additionally, in pilgrims with diabetes (1) and hypertension (HTN), the odds of ESKD are 2.33 and 3.345 times, respectively. Results show that the mean total hospital costs are $4178.4. Conclusion The present study shows a significant difference in the prevalence of ESKD in age, gender, and distribution in different provinces. To reduce the mortality and morbidity of ESKD patients, appropriate medication prescriptions, on-time dialysis, lifestyle modifications, and the reduction of disease complications through consultation with a nephrologist are essential during Hajj.

PMC12536825,Impact of Sodium Bicarbonate Supplementation on Kidney Function and Acid-Base Balance in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients: A Systematic Review.,2025,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health burden, with metabolic acidosis being a common complication that accelerates disease progression and contributes to muscle wasting, bone demineralization, and systemic inflammation. Sodium bicarbonate (SB) supplementation is widely used to correct acidosis, but its effects on kidney function and clinical outcomes remain inconsistent. This systematic review evaluates the impact of SB on kidney function, acid-base balance, and secondary outcomes in patients with CKD. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library up to May 2025. Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,354 patients were included. Studies assessed the effects of SB on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum bicarbonate, muscle mass, blood pressure, and adverse events. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool. SB supplementation consistently improved serum bicarbonate levels across all included studies, with statistically significant increases reported. The impact on kidney function, however, was variable, with some trials demonstrating improved eGFR while others showed no significant benefit. Positive effects on muscle mass preservation were observed in several studies, though physical function and blood pressure outcomes remained inconsistent. The intervention was generally well-tolerated, though gastrointestinal-related adverse events were more frequent with bicarbonate therapy compared to controls. Methodological quality was strong overall, with most studies demonstrating low risk of bias. SB effectively corrects metabolic acidosis in CKD but demonstrates variable effects on kidney function and secondary outcomes. Benefits appear most pronounced in early-to-moderate CKD, while patients with advanced disease may derive limited renal protection. Clinicians should individualize therapy, balancing biochemical correction with tolerability and cost. Future research should prioritize long-term trials with standardized outcomes to clarify the role of SB in CKD management. Conclusions SB supplementation effectively corrects metabolic acidosis in CKD patients but yields inconsistent benefits for kidney function and variable effects on secondary outcomes. The therapy appears most promising for preserving renal function in early to moderate CKD and improving nutritional parameters, though its value in advanced CKD remains uncertain. Clinicians should weigh the potential benefits against the risks of adverse events and individualize treatment based on patient characteristics and preferences. Future research should prioritize large, long-term trials with standardized outcome measures, mechanistic substudies to elucidate the pathways linking acidosis correction to clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness analyses to guide resource allocation. Until such evidence emerges, bicarbonate therapy should be judiciously employed as one component of a comprehensive CKD management strategy, rather than as a universal intervention.",0.3268171138893676,0.3268171138893676,0.08475980573479255,0.08475980573479255,0.2814098789624526,0.2814098789624526,0.50957652780785,0.50957652780785,0.4633054600862996,0.4812084611251938,0.3531979212185076,0.49837122340005846,0.38949124676389535,1
PMC12507388,Beginning of ABO-Incompatible Transplants in Pakistan: A Single-Centre Experience.,2025,"Background The burden of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is ever-increasing in Pakistan. Among the treatment options available, kidney transplantation remains the most effective treatment for ESRD, offering improved quality of life and survival benefits over dialysis. ABO blood group incompatibility has traditionally been viewed as a barrier to transplantation. However, we have started ABO-incompatible (ABOi) renal transplant in Pakistan since 2023 with good clinical outcomes. Objectives This study aims to document the initiation of ABOi renal transplants in Pakistan, while evaluating clinical outcomes, immunological responses, and long-term graft survival rates, with a focus on the development and further improvement of pre-transplant desensitisation regimens. Methods A retrospective study was conducted at our centre on ABOi renal transplants from February 2023 to March 2025. A total of 15 ABOi renal transplants were included. The desensitisation protocol developed included immunomodulation with rituximab, followed by low-dose immunosuppression and membrane plasma separation for preformed antibody depletion. Induction therapy was performed using anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg/day), mycophenolate mofetil or MMF (2000 mg/day), and prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day). All patients were given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 on alternate days for six months as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), valganciclovir 450 mg per day against cytomegalovirus (CMV) for three months, and fluconazole 50 mg per day for one month as antifungal prophylaxis. Results The highest antibody titers pre-transplant were 1/512 (IgG) and 1/256 (IgM). Five sessions of plasmapheresis were done for 13 (86.7%) patients, while two (13.3%) underwent immunoadsorption (IA). The cutoff of 1:4 was established to go ahead with the transplant. Overall graft survival was 86.7%. Three (20.0%) patients developed cellular rejection, which was successfully treated. One (6.7%) patient died with a functioning graft due to secondary complications. The main complications encountered were development of lymphocele, urinary leakage, lower respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection. Conclusion We conclude that the ABOi renal transplants in Pakistan show favourable results. Further adoption of this method can expand the donor pool for patients with ESRD. Conclusions ABOi renal transplantation is both feasible and effective, even within resource-limited settings. Our experience with 15 patients demonstrated promising outcomes, characterised by low rates of rejection and complications. A standardised desensitisation protocol and structured post-transplant follow-up underpinned the success of the programme. While challenges such as cost constraints, logistical hurdles, and elevated baseline antibody titers persist, they remain manageable with appropriate planning. These findings support the viability of ABOi transplant programmes as a means to broaden access and reduce wait times in countries like Pakistan.",0.4395469002635052,0.4395469002635052,0.11424075921035856,0.11424075921035856,0.8665996330436615,0.8665996330436615,0.9811043656799034,0.9811043656799034,0.9582943835778953,0.8435684673155764,0.684801596678033,0.9633684653027562,0.7544433138342138,1
PMC12506150,"Estimates of non-communicable disease expenditure by disease phase, sex, and age group for all OECD countries.",2025,"Background NCD expenditure estimates are necessary to estimate future health system expenditure trajectories for different prevention and treatment policies. However, no dataset of comparable estimates exists across OECD countries. This study generates disease expenditure estimates for all 38 OECD member countries in 2019, for 80 major NCDs by disease phase, sex, and age group. Methods Australian health expenditure (per person) by sex and age group was disaggregated by disease phase (first year of diagnosis, last year of life if dying of disease, otherwise prevalent) using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data and New Zealand estimates of relative expenditure ratios by phase. These estimates were applied to GBD estimated case numbers in each OECD country and scaled to each country’s total health system expenditure to estimate expenditure by NCDs in 2019. OECD purchasing power parities were used to adjust estimates to United States (US) dollars for cross-country comparability. Comparisons were made to pre-existing disease expenditure estimates for Norway, Switzerland, and the US. Results Average NCD expenditure across OECD countries was US$207 million per 100,000 population. Pooled across countries, musculoskeletal disorders had the highest proportion of total health expenditure (17.4%), followed by cancer (9.4%), and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (9.1%). Within diseases, the percentage of expenditure was higher for females for musculoskeletal disorders (56.1%), mental and substance use disorders (55.8%), and neurological conditions (54.8%). For males, it was kidney and urinary diseases (63.8%), cancer (58.3%), and CVD (50.7%). First year of diagnosis represented on average 36.8% of total NCD expenditure, while last year of life expenditure accounted for 2.6%. While there were similarities between our expenditure estimates and pre-existing country-specific estimates for Norway, Switzerland and the US, notable differences were observed for musculoskeletal disorders, cancer, and mental and substance use disorders. Conclusions Our estimates represent a starting point for a cross-national dataset of disease-specific expenditure that can be used to forecast future expenditure and potential health system cost savings of preventive and treatment policies.

Methods This retrospective, observational study used Optum’s de-identified Market Clarity Data (Optum ® Market Clarity) (2017–2019). Dialysis-dependent patients with anemia of ESKD were stratified by mean hemoglobin level (below, within, or above the target range of 10.0–11.5 g/dL) and time within hemoglobin target range (TiR; high, ≥ 60% or low, < 60% of hemoglobin measurements within the target range) over a 9-month exposure assessment period following initiation of anemia treatment. Incidence rates of HCRU per-person year and annual mean costs were compared between groups weighted by inverse probability weighting during the outcomes assessment period (day after exposure assessment period until earliest of renal transplantation date, end of eligibility, or data availability [March 31, 2022], or death). Results Of 2,279 eligible patients, 37.1%, 44.1%, and 18.8% had mean hemoglobin levels below, within, and above the target range, respectively, and 78.2% had low TiR. Patients with hemoglobin levels within the target range had a significant cost reduction of $6,201 in red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, and significantly lower incidence of RBC transfusions (46%) and inpatient visits (20%) compared to those below the target range. Mean hemoglobin level within versus above the target range was associated with a significantly higher incidence rate of inpatient visits (14%) and annual costs ($1,958) for RBC transfusions. Patients with high versus low TiR had significantly lower incidence rate of RBC transfusion visits (43%) and inpatient visits (19%), and a significant total healthcare cost reduction of $33,921.

PMC12291391,Cost-utility analysis of dapagliflozin for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure in Spain.,2025,"Background The objective of this study was to perform a cost-utility analysis of dapagliflozin, as an add-on therapy to standard of care (SoC), compared with SoC, for patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure (HF) in Spain, including patients with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. Methods A Markov model was designed to simulate the progression of chronic HF over a lifetime horizon using pooled data from the DAPA-HF and DELIVER trials. Disease progression was captured by transitions between health states, defined by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptom Score. Transient events of hospitalization for HF (HHF), urgent HF visits (UHFV) and cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV death were included. The analysis was conducted from the Spanish National Health System perspective. The results were expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results. Results Dapagliflozin + SoC showed an increase in effectiveness (0.31 QALY) and total cost per patient (€1,441) compared to SoC, yielding an incremental cost-utility ratio of €4,611/QALY. Dapagliflozin reduced the incidence of HHF by 136.4 events (752.2 vs. 886.6), UHFV by 38.8 (217.6 vs. 254.4) and CV death by 23.0 (505.8 vs. 528.8) for every 1,000 patients. Dapagliflozin + SoC was cost-effective compared to SoC in 99.9% of iterations at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of €25,000/QALY.

PMC12545811,Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and UK Kidney Association Joint Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Pharmacological Management of Hyperglycemia in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and CKD.,2025,"A growing and significant number of people with diabetes develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes-related CKD is a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). People with diabetes and CKD have high morbidity and mortality, predominantly related to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hyperglycemia and hypertension are modifiable risk factors to prevent the onset and progression of CKD and related CVD. Recent clinical trials of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and CKD have demonstrated reduction in composite kidney end point events (significant decline in kidney function, need for kidney replacement therapy, and kidney-related death) and cardiovascular risk with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRAs) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs). The Association of British Clinical Diabetologists and UK Kidney Association Diabetic Kidney Disease Clinical Speciality Group have previously undertaken a narrative review and critical appraisal of the available evidence to inform clinical practice guidelines for the pharmacological management of hyperglycemia in adults with T2DM and CKD. This 2025 abbreviated updated guidance by a multidisciplinary group of health care professionals from primary and secondary care settings summarizes the key recommendations, clinical considerations and recent evidence that has implications for clinical practice for health care professionals who treat people with T2DM and CKD. Conclusion People with T2DM and CKD have increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Hyperglycemia is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular complications and progression of CKD. Individualized HbA1c targets should be applied in the management of people with CKD, using the levels suggested in this guidance. Delaying ESKD and reducing CVD risk are essential to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. There is now conclusive evidence and consensus that SGLT-2 inhibitors significantly reduce progression of CKD and onset of ESKD in people with T2DM and CKD on top of standard care, which is RAS inhibition. More recently there is evidence for the use nsMRA and GLP-1 RA which can also delay progression of CKD, which has resulted in a concept of pillars of cardio-renal pharmacotherapy for CKD and thereby the potential for addressing residual cardio-renal risk with a multipronged approach with medications that act on distinct pathways to confer organ protection. 9 , 47 Despite advances in the field, a major barrier is the lack of implementation and inequality of access or delivery of guideline-based interventions and treatments for people with T2DM and CKD. 48 In view of this, we propose a tiered approach with addressing key foundational goals first to address cardio-renal disease in T2DM and CKD. 38 Indeed because most people with T2DM will succumb to premature CVD before reaching ESKD, it is essential that a cardio-renal focus is emphasized from the outset. In Figure 2 , we highlight the tiered approach we propose to address burden of CKD progression as well as high CVD risk in people with T2DM and CKD. We acknowledge that there is currently limited randomized control trial data on the role of combination therapy or triple therapy with GLP-1 RA, SGLT-2 inhibitors, or nsMRA on reducing progression of kidney disease. The available data to date from secondary or subanalyses of trials, simulation type analyses from recent studies, and real world data suggest potential complementary and additive effects; and in our opinion, combination treatment of GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2 inhibitors should be considered early in the management of CKD in people with diabetes. 49 Such a combination approach may aid cardio-renal risk reduction by targeting residual risk and improve glycemic control with low risk of hypoglycemia in people with T2DM and CKD. In people with residual albuminuria despite combination treatment with GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2 inhibitors, adding in a nsMRA in people at high risk of progression to kidney failure or with known heart failure may be appropriate and should be considered.

PMC12465708,A qualitative study of nephrologists' perspectives on implementing a nephrology rapid response model for acute kidney injury.,2025,"Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) poses major health and economic burdens, especially in low-resource settings like Palestine. This study explores nephrologists’ perspectives on implementing the Nephrology Rapid Response Team (NRRT) model, highlighting key barriers, facilitators, and strategic priorities to improve AKI care. Study Design A qualitative, exploratory study design was employed to gain in-depth nephrologists’ perspectives on the feasibility of implementing the Nephrology Rapid Response Team (NRRT) model in Palestinian hospitals. Methods Thirteen board-certified nephrologists were recruited using purposive sampling. Semi-structured interviews were conducted between January and May 2024, with data transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically using MAXQDA Analytics Pro software. Thematic analysis identified key facilitators, barriers, and recommendations. Rigorous methodological strategies ensured the credibility, dependability, and transferability of the findings. Results Five enablers themes emerged that could facilitate integration of the model: strategic backing from the Ministry of Health, a growing orientation toward prevention-driven healthcare policies, enhanced multidisciplinary collaboration with early nephrologist engagement, institutional endorsement through hospital-based systems, and the progressive adoption of technological innovations such as electronic alert systems and novel biomarkers. On the other hand, five dominant barrier themes emerged. These include systemic governance and policy fragmentation, financial and operational limitations, a pronounced shortage of nephrology specialists, insufficient awareness and prevention frameworks, and weak collaboration and surveillance systems—particularly the lack of a national renal registry. Despite these obstacles, nephrologists expressed optimism, offering three central recommendations to support sustainable implementation. These include systemic policy and governance reforms, investments in nephrology education and training programs, and the expansion of public awareness and prevention strategies through primary care engagement. Together, these strategies represent a foundational roadmap for overcoming structural challenges and AKI care delivery through the NRRT model. Conclusions This study highlights the Ministry of Health’s critical role in leading reforms for NRRT implementation, emphasizing prevention, technology, and capacity-building as priorities to improve nephrology care.

This review explores the epidemiology, risk factors, screening strategies, and clinical manifestations of CKD within primary care settings. PCPs are integral in recognizing at‐risk populations, initiating timely screening through eGFR and albuminuria tests, and managing modifiable risk factors like hypertension and diabetes. The article discusses current guideline‐recommended pharmacologic therapies—including RAAS inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP‐1 receptor agonists, and non‐steroidal MRAs—that slow disease progression. Lifestyle modifications and dietary interventions are emphasized as essential components of care. Additionally, the review outlines key indications for nephrology referral and the management of common CKD complications, such as anemia and mineral‐bone disorder. By embracing a proactive and multidisciplinary approach, PCPs can significantly influence CKD outcomes, reduce progression to end‐stage renal disease, and improve overall patient prognosis. 11 CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, chronic kidney disease remains a significant global health concern, highlighting the pivotal role of primary care physicians. Their proactive engagement in early detection through routine eGFR and UACR screening, coupled with diligent management of key risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, is fundamental. By integrating evidence‐based pharmacological therapies, including newer agents like SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP‐1 RAs for cardiorenal protection, and adeptly managing emerging complications, PCPs substantially influence the trajectory of CKD.

PMC12540302,Incremental peritoneal dialysis: less is more-for the patient and the planet.,2025,"Climate change poses growing threat to global health, and paradoxically, the health-care sector—including nephrology—is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Dialysis, in particular, is resource-intensive. Yet, dialysis remains life-saving for over 4 million people globally, a number projected to rise sharply. While peritoneal dialysis (PD) offers a home-based alternative to hemodialysis with potentially lower environmental costs, it still generates considerable carbon emissions and waste—especially from the production, packaging, and transport of dialysate solutions. A typical continuous ambulatory PD patient generates over 600 kg of waste per year, much of it non-biodegradable polyvinyl chloride. PD’s carbon footprint ranges from 1.2 to 4.5 tons of CO₂-equivalent annually, primarily from packaging and transport. Incremental peritoneal dialysis (iPD)—an approach that starts therapy at a reduced dose based on residual kidney function (RKF)—offers a more sustainable model. Incremental PD reduces water usage, plastic waste, and carbon emissions by as much as 30–45% compared to full-dose PD. Clinically, iPD is associated with better quality of life, fewer infections, less glucose exposure, and potential preservation of RKF. Economically, it offers substantial cost savings, with estimates up to €8,700 saved annually per patient. Despite its benefits, barriers to iPD adoption include provider unfamiliarity, patient reluctance to intensify treatment, reimbursement limitations, and the need for close RKF monitoring and clinical assessment. Addressing these challenges through policy reform, education, and digital tools could enable broader implementation of iPD, aligning kidney care with environmental stewardship. Conclusion Incremental peritoneal dialysis is a powerful yet underutilized tool in the pursuit of sustainable kidney care. By aligning with the principles of green nephrology, iPD reduces resource consumption, medical waste, and environmental emissions, while offering safe and effective treatment to patients with residual kidney function. As healthcare systems confront the twin challenges of climate change and chronic disease burden, adopting ecologically conscious approaches like iPD is not only advisable but necessary. Future dialysis paradigms must move beyond survival toward sustainability—and iPD offers a pragmatic, evidence-based path forward.",0.5901931469149306,0.5901931469149306,0.40071451843775263,0.40071451843775263,0.41356308963600696,0.41356308963600696,0.6453638057855636,0.6453638057855636,0.6539430189514053,0.7681125239871217,0.5475156350163396,0.5732261375916182,0.5539432606601592,1
PMC12476777,Automated peritoneal dialysis with shortened break-in periods in urgent-start scenarios: A retrospective cohort study.,2025,"BACKGROUND End-stage kidney disease is a growing global health burden with many patients requiring urgent kidney replacement therapy. Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (PD) has emerged as a viable alternative to hemodialysis particularly in resource-limited settings. However, concerns remain regarding catheter-related complications associated with early initiation of PD. Automated PD (APD) offers enhanced flexibility and fluid management, but evidence regarding its safety and outcomes in urgent-start scenarios with shortened break-in periods is limited. AIM To evaluate the clinical outcomes and biochemical changes associated with urgent-start APD with a shortened break-in period. METHODS This was a single center, observational study that included 62 patients with end-stage kidney disease who required urgent-start dialysis, underwent PD catheter placement, and received APD. Patients were stratified based on catheter opening time (< 12 hours vs > 12 hours). Catheter-related complications, biochemical parameters, and dialysis efficacy were analyzed. RESULTS The median catheter opening time was 11 h (interquartile range: 8-14 hours). No significant differences in catheter-related complications were observed between groups ( P > 0.05). Catheter dysfunction, migration, leakage, and replacement occurred in 14.5%, 9.7%, 12.9%, and 11.3% of patients, respectively. APD led to significant reductions in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urea, phosphorus, and potassium ( P < 0.05), alongside correction of metabolic acidosis. No cases of peritonitis or hemoperitoneum were observed. CONCLUSION Urgent-start APD with shortened break-in appears safe with low complication rates and improved biochemical outcomes.

Research Design and Methods : A qualitative phenomenological study was conducted with 50 adult T2DM patients on PD or HD who used CGM for at least 14 days. Semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis framework was applied to identify major themes regarding insulin management, CGM utilization, and emotional and social dimensions. Results: Four main themes emerged, each with multiple subthemes. PD patients emphasized enhanced autonomy and frequent insulin adjustments due to dialysate glucose absorption. Conversely, HD patients reported severe post-dialysis fatigue, emotional distress, and limited social engagement often associated with intra-dialytic hypoglycemia. CGM was valued by 85% of participants for improving metabolic awareness and self-management. However, 15% reported barriers such as device cost and technical difficulties. The insights clearly distinguish the differential impact of dialysis modality on daily glucose control and patient well-being. Conclusions: These findings underscore the critical need for patient-centered care incorporating access to CGM and tailored insulin regimens. Equitable implementation of CGM in dialysis settings could significantly enhance glycemic control, emotional resilience, and overall quality of life. 5. Conclusions The results indicate that, in addition to conventional clinical indicators, the patient’s subjective experience, including economic barriers to accessing technological innovations like CGM and the emotional challenges associated with each treatment modality, should be considered a central element in therapeutic decision-making.

This study explored the barriers and facilitators influencing screening among T2DM patients and providers at the diabetic clinic of Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital. Methods A qualitative cross-sectional study guided by a phenomenological approach to explore lived experiences around nephropathy screening was conducted. Fifteen adult T2DM patients in care for ≥12 months and five healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, and a laboratory technician) were purposively sampled. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted. Data were analyzed using an inductive approach. Socio-demographics; including age, sex, education, and employment were collected. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed using Dedoose (version 10.0.25). Study reporting adhered to the COREQ 32-item checklist. Results Patients described diabetes as a burdensome and life-altering condition. Key barriers to nephropathy screening included financial constraints, lack of transport, limited awareness, and dissatisfaction with care. Despite these challenges, facilitators such as proactive provider encouragement, community outreach, and availability of free testing motivated screening uptake. Providers emphasized their critical role in educating patients and detecting nephropathy but reported systemic constraints, including staff shortages, equipment failures, limited knowledge on new disease trends and screening protocols. Both groups highlighted the need for routine integration of nephropathy screening into diabetes care and greater support from the health system. Conclusion Nephropathy screening behaviors among T2DM patients are influenced by perceived disease severity, provider communication, and systemic barriers such as cost and infrastructure. While both patients and providers recognize the value of early detection, sustained screening is hindered by resource limitations and inconsistent implementation. Strengthening institutional capacity, integrating screening into routine care, and enhancing patient-provider engagement are essential to reducing the burden of diabetic nephropathy in the study setting.

Methods Prevalence, key adverse outcomes, health care costs, and use of kidney-protective treatment, up until December 31st, 2022, were described in patients aged > 18 years in Norway using register-based data. Only diagnosis codes were used to identify patients with CKD, with laboratory measurements of estimated-glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria unavailable. Utilisation of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and renin-angiotensin system [RAS] inhibitors were evaluated in new users following the first Norwegian approval of an SGLT-2 inhibitor for CKD treatment. Results Approximately 3% (125,163 patients) of adults in Norway had diagnosed CKD (average age 70 years, 42% women, 73% without T2D). When describing patients with or without T2D, history of heart failure (22% versus 22%), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD; 57% versus 51%), and atrial fibrillation (24% versus 27%) were similar. Larger proportions of those with T2D received SGLT-2 inhibitors (24% versus 4%) and/or RAS inhibitors (63% versus 47%). Hospitalisations for CKD (28.1 versus 22.1 events per 100 patient years), heart failure (12.6 versus 9.8), myocardial infarction (3.9 versus 2.2), and stroke (3.2 versus 2.3) were more common in patients with CKD and T2D than those without T2D. However, mortality (10.8 versus 8.5) was higher in patients without T2D. CKD and heart failure costs were higher than those for ASCVD, and generally higher in patients with T2D. SGLT-2 inhibitor utilisation increased two-fold the year after its approval but was still low, used mostly at its highest target dose. Discontinuation rates were lower with SGLT-2 inhibitors than with RAS inhibitors, the latter mostly utilised at low doses. Conclusions A CKD diagnosis was associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, costs, and undertreatment, both in patients with and without T2D.

PMC12378438,Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in patients with chronic kidney disease: a review of evidence and current practice in the UK,2025,"ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) represent an extant local and global syndemic, with TB incidence rates in the UK end-stage renal failure population far surpassing those of the general population in endemic countries. Patients with CKD generally have latent TB reactivation, rather than de novo infection, which presents with atypical, non-pulmonary presentations leading to late diagnosis, poorer outcomes and a high risk of widespread transmission through haemodialysis units. There is therefore a need to consider latent TB infection screening in the CKD population. However, there is widespread variation in local screening practices in the UK due to the challenge of diagnosing latent TB in CKD, and the absence of robust evidence-based guidelines. There is also concern that although a screening programme may have significant public health benefit, it may cause harm to the individual patient through adverse effects of treatment. In this review, we present the current evidence for latent TB infection screening in CKD, including the evidence of benefit and harm to the individual and the public. We also review current practices in the UK and present survey data from renal units in England demonstrating the diversity of policies currently in place. We advocate screening for latent TB in all CKD patients commencing dialysis and we highlight the pressing research questions that need to be urgently answered to help move towards a cohesive national policy to help drive evidence-based consistent care. CONCLUSION Evidence from different global settings suggests that LTBI screening in specific subgroups of the CKD cohort would confer benefit. The WHO and many other high-income countries with similar healthcare systems to the UK advocate screening for LTBI in the pre-dialysis and RRT new starter populations. Based on the current evidence and information from the annual UK Tuberculosis Report, we also advocate this approach, accepting that the current diagnostics are suboptimal and further research is required in this area. Comparing outcomes across UK renal centres with divergent screening policies would provide important evidence to drive recommendations, and a data linkage study combining data from the UK Tuberculosis Report and the UK Renal Registry would further strengthen the evidence base for recommendations. Emerging diagnostics and AI-driven approaches hold promise for improving screening and treatment strategies, but more high-quality evidence is needed to guide clinical practice. The magnitude of this syndemic is only predicted to grow in the coming years and answering these questions should therefore be a research priority. In conclusion, patients with CKD, particularly those with ESRD requiring dialysis, face a substantially heightened risk of TB reactivation. However, the identification and management of LTBI in this population remains complex and challenging. Existing diagnostic tools lack accuracy in immunocompromised patients, leading to potential underdiagnosis or overtreatment. Furthermore, the decision to initiate LTBI therapy must carefully weigh the risks—such as drug toxicity and interactions—against the benefits, especially in older patients with multiple comorbidities. Addressing these challenges requires more precise diagnostic strategies, individualized risk assessment and a multidisciplinary approach to optimize patient outcomes.",0.7711022444135682,0.7711022444135682,0.11785023078625641,0.11785023078625641,0.5906698394582867,0.5906698394582867,0.536506165717504,0.536506165717504,0.8387562540616188,0.7560377974128881,0.6332404593585722,0.684692678210786,0.6461035140716256,1
PMC12517420,Non-invasive assessment techniques for renal fibrosis: advances and perspectives.,2025,"Abstract Renal fibrosis is a critical pathological process driving chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Early diagnosis is essential for timely intervention, yet traditional methods like renal biopsy are invasive and present significant limitations. Consequently, noninvasive techniques are gaining attention for renal fibrosis assessment. Biomarkers such as transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGF-D) have been explored for monitoring fibrosis progression, though their specificity and reliability challenges persist. Emerging imaging techniques, including molecular and functional imaging, offer valuable structural and functional insights but remain limited in detecting early-stage fibrosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool to enhance diagnostic accuracy by integrating imaging and biomarker data. Machine learning algorithms applied to ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have demonstrated improved predictive capabilities for renal fibrosis detection. Furthermore, AI-driven multimodal approaches, combining clinical, imaging, and biomarker data, provide new opportunities for accurate, noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring. Despite these advancements, challenges such as small sample sizes, lack of standardization, and AI model interpretability must be addressed. Future research should focus on refining noninvasive biomarkers, improving imaging techniques, and developing AI-driven models to enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical applicability in renal fibrosis assessment.

PMC12553874,Gout therapy updated.,2025,"Gout is a common and painful inflammatory arthritis caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition into joints in the setting of hyperuricemia. Recent reports indicate an increase in prevalence and incidence of gout worldwide. While genetics, dietary habits, and lifestyle play a significant role in the development of gout, risk factors also include diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic disease among others. As such, accompanying comorbidities must also be considered when choosing therapeutic agents for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and gout flares. This article will focus on reviewing gout pathophysiology and discussion of currently available pharmacological and nonpharmacological options for chronic gout management, gout flare therapy, and prophylactic measures. Despite an increase in prevalence, optimal gout management remains elusive and challenging with only a third to half of patients receiving definitive treatment and fewer than half of patients remaining adherent to treatment. Current strategies for optimal chronic gout management include the “treat to target” method, which focuses on targeting serum urate level of 5–6 mg/dL or lower. Additional approaches for chronic gout management include starting ULTs with 3–6 months of prophylaxis to reduce the risk of precipitating gout flares during initiation. Both improvement of the recognition and diagnosis of gout and more widespread provider adherence to international rheumatology society recommendations for gout management remain barriers to optimal gout management worldwide. This article will also serve as a review of current urate-lowering pharmacological options including xanthine oxidase inhibitors, uricosurics, and uricase therapy as well as burgeoning new medications on the horizon including novel potent xanthine oxidase inhibitors (including tigulixostat), sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors, and selective URAT1 inhibitors. Additionally, this article will review pharmacological approaches to treating gout flares (including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, and colchicine) and discuss the role of patient comorbidities in selection of optimal therapy. The present review will also discuss the role and limitations of novel interleukin-1 (IL-1) antagonists (including anakinra and canakinumab) in the treatment of gout flares. Lastly, this article will also discuss nonpharmacological intervention for gout management and discuss novel therapies for chronic gout management, gout flare, and prophylaxis on the horizon. Conclusion Gout is a common and painful inflammatory arthritis with increasing prominence. However, despite increased prevalence and incidence of gout worldwide, inadequate management of gout continues to persist with only a third to half of patients receiving definitive treatment in the form of ULTs and fewer than half of patients adequately compliant with treatment. 62 A summarized version of the pharmacological approaches to gout treatment can be found in Figures 1 and 2 . Initiation of ULTs with 3–6 months of prophylaxis serves to reduce serum urate levels while preventing gout flares during initiation of therapy. Employment of the “treat-to-target” approach to gout management serves to reduce the serum urate level to at least 6 mg/dL and empowers providers to increase ULT with guidance, leading to improvement of hyperuricemia and reduction of gout flares. Failure of adoption of “treat-to-target” methods in favor of “treatment to avoid symptoms” methods result in the persistence of inadequate treatment of gout. In addition to ULT, careful selection of pharmacologic agent for gout flare treatment and early initiation of prophylaxis also serves to reduce the burden of gout symptoms and restore patient quality of life ( Table 1 ). In addition, multidisciplinary management of gout with “augmented” clinic, involving nurses, clinical pharmacists, primary care doctors, or rheumatologists are progressively being implemented and improving outcomes compared with routine care. 17 Nurse-led gout treatment approaches have demonstrated robust ULT adherence, urate level reduction, and improved outcomes for many patients, including those with multiple comorbidities. 63 With aggressive management, disease progression can be halted and patient quality of life and functionality restored. Finally, gout management and flare prevention are acquiring new relevance as these painful episodes seems to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular outcomes 64 and pleiotropic agents for prevention of cardiovascular disease, metabolic management in diabetes, and progression of CKD are promising for inclusion in the gout armamentarium. 36 Table 1.

PMC12522658,Health and economic gains from bariatric surgery in Portugal: an in-depth analysis using a Markov model.,2025,"Background Obesity is a chronic condition with significant health and economic impact worldwide. While conventional treatments, including dietary changes, lifestyle modifications, and non-targeted pharmacotherapy, are widely used, their long-term effectiveness in sustaining weight loss remains limited. Metabolic and bariatric surgery has shown superior clinical benefits, including comorbidity remission and increased life expectancy, but its initial cost raises concerns about its economic viability compared to non-surgical treatments. Therefore, this study assesses the long-term cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery versus conventional treatment, considering health outcomes and economic impact within the Portuguese healthcare. Methods The patient journey was mapped based on clinical guidelines and adapted to the Portuguese context via stakeholder interviews. Obesity prevalence and associated comorbidities were estimated using epidemiological data. A Markov model was created to simulate obesity progression over ten, twenty years, and lifetime horizons, using monthly cycles. The model accounts for weight regain, complications, and different health states, including obesity with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, cancer, and death. It was implemented in R Studio using heemod package. Direct healthcare costs and health outcomes were calculated. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), with 500 iterations, was conducted to assess uncertainty. Results The results demonstrate that bariatric surgery, compared to conventional treatment, enhances life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and reduces obesity-related comorbidities. Over 10 years, surgery yields 6 QALYs to each patient costing 9243€, compared to 4.9 QALYs and a cost of 6328€ for the non-surgical arm. The cost-effectiveness analysis shows that, despite higher initial costs, bariatric surgery is cost-effective over time. The incremental cost per QALY gained is estimated at 2756€, positioning bariatric surgery as an economically advantageous intervention at commonly accepted willingness-to-pat thresholds (WTP). After 20 years, this strategy emerges as dominant, improving health outcomes while reducing overall costs. On the lifetime horizon, surgical patients gain 7 additional QALYs and cost 4534€ less than non-surgical patients. PSA shows that the cost-effectiveness of this strategy is maintained. Conclusion The analysis suggests that surgery is an effective strategy to improve outcomes and managing expenses. Future research should refine the model exploring upcoming treatment strategies as additional evidence on its outcomes becomes available.

PMC12490938,Analysis of the current transition readiness of adolescent patients with kidney disease and the factors influencing it.,2025,"Background This study aimed to investigate the transition readiness of adolescent patients with kidney disease to understand their readiness status and ability to transition to adult healthcare and study the influencing factors, to provide a theoretical basis for improving the transition readiness of adolescent patients with kidney disease and developing intervention strategies. Methods The study sample was obtained from the follow-up data of the pediatric department at the General Hospital of the Eastern Theater of Operations from December 2024 to January 2025, and patients aged 13–18 years with renal disease were selected as the study subjects. The scores of the Chinese version of the Self-Management and Transitional Readiness Questionnaire were used to determine the readiness status of the study subjects, and binary logistic regression was used to analyze the influencing factors. Results A total of 242 questionnaires were distributed, and 12 invalid questionnaires were excluded, resulting in the inclusion of 230 samples for the analysis. Transitional readiness was at a low level in 123 cases (53.48%) and at a medium-high level in 107 cases (46.52%). The results of the binary logistic regression showed that the number of hospitalizations, treatment modalities, place of residence, caregiver's literacy, monthly income, and healthcare payment method were influencing factors for transition readiness in adolescent patients with kidney disease ( P < 0.05). Conclusion The readiness of adolescent patients with kidney disease during their transition to adulthood is not ideal and is affected by a combination of factors related to themselves, their families, and their socioeconomic status. The relevant medical personnel should implement a multidimensional approach and carry out targeted interventions to improve these patients’ readiness for the transition.

PMC12524541,The Hidden Risks of Hip Replacement: Unveiling Mortality and Costs in 1.6 Million Patients.,2025,"Methods: Using the most recent pre-COVID National Inpatient Sample (2016–2019), we evaluated inpatient mortality and economic impact after elective primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) across 327,123 cases (1,635,615 weighted discharges).Results: Overall inpatient mortality was 0.04%, but was higher in patients ≥ 80 years (0.15%), with weekend admissions (0.10%), and with surgical delay ≥ 1 day (0.17%). Comorbidities with the greatest mortality association included congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease (both with markedly elevated odds), and acute in-hospital complications (e.g., pulmonary embolism) carried substantial risk. Complications also increased resource use; for example, heart failure, pulmonary edema, and acute coronary artery disease were each associated with significantly higher costs and prolonged length of stay. Conclusion: These findings provide a contemporary, pre-pandemic national baseline that quantifies high-risk subgroups and the economic footprint of adverse events, supporting targeted perioperative strategies and hospital planning for elective THA. 5. Conclusions Using the largest pre-COVID nationwide cohort of elective THA cases, we found that inpatient mortality, while rare (0.04%), is concentrated among octogenarians and patients with CHF or CKD. System-level factors such as weekend admission and surgical delay ≥ 1 day were associated with markedly higher risk, identifying actionable targets for process improvement. Complications—including pulmonary embolism, heart failure, and acute coronary events—were not only linked to mortality but also drove substantial increases in cost and length of stay. These findings provide a contemporary baseline for perioperative risk stratification and underscore the economic benefit of preventing complications.

However, current treatment measures still need further improvements to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Therefore, our team developed Bufei Yishen (BFYS) granules specifically for patients with frequent exacerbator phenotype in COPD and is conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to validate their effectiveness. Methods A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted. A total of 848 patients will participate in the study, with a treatment duration of 1 year. The participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group in a 1:1 ratio. Both groups will receive health education and conventional drugs. In addition, the experimental group will receive BFYS granules, while the control group will be given the corresponding BFYS placebo. The primary outcome is the frequency of AECOPD. The secondary outcomes include the frequency of AECOPD leading to hospitalization, the mortality rate, lung function, six-minute walk distance (6MWD), clinical symptoms and signs scores, and quality of life. Safety outcomes include vital signs and laboratory tests. Statistical analysis will be conducted using SPSS software (version 25.0). Furthermore, the health economics evaluation of the BFYS granules will use cost-effectiveness analysis methods.

PMC12348168,Economic Evaluation of System-Wide Implementation of Kidney Supportive Care,2025,"Introduction This evaluation explored the economic value of kidney supportive care (KSC) in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) receiving dialysis or conservative management for ESKD in the public health system of New South Wales, Australia. Methods Deidentified patient-level data were extracted from a linked dataset of admitted and nonadmitted patient data, emergency department episodes, and death registrations. Data between 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2019 were compared with usual treatment prior to statewide KSC implementation in the 2015-2016 financial years. A cost-benefit analysis model estimated the current economic value of KSC (1 July 2015 to 30 June 2019) and projected value to 30 June 2030 under different scenarios. Results The proportion of all patients with ESKD receiving KSC increased from 5% in 2015 to 2016 ( n = 443) to 16% by 2018 to 2019. Over this period, KSC was estimated to increase survival by 3 to 21 weeks, depending on patient characteristics. Projections showed that continued delivery of KSC, with ESKD treatment modality patterns and costs remaining stable, would deliver a net economic benefit of A$ 109 million through avoided costs of care and return on investment (ROI) of 212%. When adjusted to include survival improvements attributable to KSC, the net economic benefit increased to A$ 275 million (ROI: 535%). Conclusion Economic evaluation of the statewide KSC service showed survival benefits and a net economic benefit 4 years after implementation. Net economic value over 10 years was estimated at A$ 275 million, which would increase with greater participation of patients with ESKD suitable for KSC.

In this study, we aimed to assess cat owner’s feedback about the use of transdermal mirtazapine. A multicentric survey-based study was conducted. A total of 70 owners answered a thorough survey about how easy it was to give, possible side effects, and their general perception about mirtazapine. Most owners reported that the application was easy, considering it effective in stimulating their cats’ appetite. Some side effects were noted, such as increased vocalization, redness of the ear, or restlessness, but these were not frequent. Few owners had used oral mirtazapine before, and most of them found the administration of transdermal formulation easier. However, some preferred the oral form due to its lower cost. The results of this study show that the use of transdermal mirtazapine is generally well accepted by owners, being an apparent compliant medication in feline medicine. Abstract Mirtazapine is an antidepressant used as an appetite stimulant in cats. This study aims to assess owner perspectives on the use of transdermal mirtazapine in cats. A multicentric survey-based study was conducted. A survey of 15 questions about efficacy, side effects, and overall perception was sent to owners of cats that had received the treatment between January 2021 and March 2023 in two European veterinary hospitals. From 108 contacted owners, 70 responses were obtained. Application to the ear was considered easy by 97% of respondents, and 91% followed the manufacturers’ instructions for alternating ears. Side effects were reported by 20%, most often increased vocalization, redness, or restlessness. Chronic kidney disease was the most common reason for prescription. Nine owners had previously used the oral form, and most of them found the transdermal option easier, although some preferred the oral version due to lower cost. Overall, 77% of owners considered the treatment effective in stimulating appetite. Regarding length of therapy, about half administered it for less than 14 days, while the rest followed the labeled duration, with longer use associated with more consistent appetite improvement. These findings highlight that transdermal mirtazapine is generally well accepted by owners, easy to administer, and effective in promoting appetite in cats. 5. Conclusions This study provides insights into cat owners’ perceptions of transdermal mirtazapine, indicating that it is generally well accepted and perceived as effective in stimulating appetite. Adverse effects were infrequently reported and mostly mild. A significant association between treatment duration and perceived efficacy was observed, highlighting an area for further investigation.

Despite the burden of CKD-aP, there are limited efficacious treatments available for its management; difelikefalin is the only approved treatment based on its efficacy and safety demonstrated in two clinical studies, namely KALM-1 and KALM-2. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of difelikefalin plus best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone when treating moderate-to-severe CKD-aP in patients receiving in-centre haemodialysis, from the perspective of the UK healthcare system. Methods : A de novo lifetime Markov health economic model was built to assess the cost-effectiveness of difelikefalin. The modelled efficacy of difelikefalin was based on data from KALM-1 and KALM-2 pooled at the patient level. The main efficacy driver was the total 5-D Itch scale score. Per-cycle probabilities of changing health states defined by CKD-aP severity were used to derive transition matrices; the model also estimated time-dependent annual probabilities of death and transplant for people on haemodialysis. An increased risk of mortality for modelled patients with very severe, severe, or moderate CKD-aP was applied. Health state utilities and management costs were based on published evidence. Results : Modelled patients treated with difelikefalin were estimated to have a reduced severity of CKD-aP. Consequently, difelikefalin plus BSC was associated with an increased life expectancy of 0.11 years per person and improved HRQoL compared with BSC alone. This translated to higher quality-adjusted life years, at 0.26 per person gained compared to BSC alone. Improved patient outcomes were achieved at an incremental cost of £7814 per person. Conclusions : Overall, at a price of £31.90/vial, difelikefalin was estimated to be a cost-effective treatment for moderate-to-severe CKD-aP at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30,000/QALY, with conclusions robust to sensitivity analysis. 5. Conclusions In this analysis, difelikefalin was estimated to be a cost-effective treatment for moderate-to-severe CKD-aP at a WTP threshold of £30,000/QALY for costs up to £31.90 per vial.

PMC12450117,Challenges in Modelling the Cost Effectiveness of Pharmacotherapies for Obesity.,2025,"The cost effectiveness of pharmacotherapies for obesity (such as semaglutide, tirzepatide, liraglutide, and newer agents) is increasingly being appraised by health technology assessment (HTA) bodies. Modelling is required to extrapolate weight change observed over relatively short clinical trial durations to long-term weight loss and associated cardio-metabolic outcomes and costs. Extrapolation is a common issue in HTA, but there is a unique challenge for anti-obesity drugs because of the number of interacting uncertainties. This is a particular concern given the substantial eligible population sizes and associated high financial decision risk of providing lifetime treatment. We describe four key challenges in modelling pharmacotherapies for obesity: (1) modelling long-term body mass index (BMI) trajectories with and without obesity pharmacotherapy, (2) modelling time on treatment, (3) using risk equations to link changes in BMI to clinical outcomes, and (4) modelling clinical outcomes not (solely) related to BMI changes. We discuss each of these challenges and the impact they have had in global HTA appraisals for pharmacotherapies. We speculate how these challenges relating to short-term clinical trials could be overcome to more robustly predict long-term outcomes and the role that observational data may play. As clinical trial and real-world evidence for technologies for obesity evolves, analysts and decision-makers need to determine which evidence sources are most appropriate and how they should be combined. Conclusion Although modelling the effects of pharmacotherapies on obesity is challenging, the decision risk is too large to ignore. Future research and ongoing re-evaluation, including analysis of real-world data, is essential to ensure decisions can be revisited, uncertainties minimised, and population health maximized.",0.25414204357264386,0.25414204357264386,0.11040082407825257,0.11040082407825257,0.32489495728395956,0.32489495728395956,0.42074511408356696,0.42074511408356696,0.3499543374147468,0.29041820723269496,0.32508906916973307,0.4249732276586877,0.35006010879197175,1
PMC11948864,Treatment of sinusitis in children: an Italian intersociety consensus (SIPPS-SIP-SITIP-FIMP-SIAIP-SIMRI-SIM-FIMMG).,2025,"Sinusitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the paranasal sinuses. Bacterial sinusitis usually occurs as a complication of viral infections of the upper respiratory tract and is a frequent cause of medical consultation. The clinical presentation of acute bacterial sinusitis can vary. It most commonly manifests as an upper respiratory tract infection (nasal congestion, postnasal drip, cough) that persists for more than 10 days without clinical improvement. Unfortunately, updated guidelines in paediatric age are not currently available. The purpose of this consensus is to provide guidelines for the therapeutic management of previous healthy paediatric patients with sinusitis. A systematic review was conducted to identify the most recent and relevant evidence. Embase, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane databases were systematically screened, combining the terms “children” and “sinusitis” and “antibiotics” and “rhinosinusitis” with a date restriction from 2012 to April 2024, but without language limitations. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methods. The final recommendations were obtained through a Delphi consensus of an expert panel. In children with a diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis, made according to strict clinical criteria, systemic empiric antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is indicated at a high dose (90 mg/kg/day, calculated based on amoxicillin, preferably in 3 daily doses) and for at least 10 days. In children with chronic sinusitis, systemic antibiotic treatment is not recommended, and it is not possible to make any specific recommendation regarding antibiotic agents due to the scarcity of scientific evidence supporting treatment. In conclusion, the diagnosis of sinusitis is primarily clinical, and despite acute sinusitis generally having a favourable course, some cases can present orbital and intracranial complications. The misuse of antibiotics in managing upper respiratory tract infections, including acute sinusitis, and the challenges posed by antibiotic resistance are a current issue in paediatric care. Due to the scarcity, heterogeneity, and poor quality of available evidence either supporting or opposing the use of systemic antibiotic therapy in children with sinusitis prospective studies on larger and more homogeneous cohort are needed. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13052-025-01868-1. Conclusion The epidemiology of bacterial sinusitis is not easily defined, and its incidence is currently unknown. Acute sinusitis has a peak incidence between 2 and 6 years of age [ 2 – 4 ], and it is estimated to occur as a complication in 0.5-2% of all upper respiratory tract viral infections [ 5 ]. Despite acute sinusitis generally having a favourable course, a percentage of cases ranging from 3.7 to 8.8% can present orbital and intracranial complications [ 10 , 29 ]. Complications are more common in young children due to the thinner walls of the paranasal sinuses. Although rare, these conditions can lead to neurological sequelae (including blindness), and even death [ 10 ]. The misuse of antibiotics in managing upper respiratory tract infections, including acute sinusitis, and the challenges posed by antibiotic resistance are a current issue in paediatric care. Unfortunately, updated guidelines based on systematic literature review conducted in the last 3–5 years are not currently available. In children with a diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis, made according to strict clinical criteria, empiric antibiotic therapy for at least 10 days is indicated to achieve rapid symptom improvement. Amoxicillin is suggested in patients with sudden onset of ≥ 2 symptoms among nasal obstruction/congestion, nasal discharge regardless of characteristics, daytime or night-time cough lasting at least 10 days. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid should be the choice for children with persistent discomfort, worsening or new onset of nasal discharge, daytime cough, or fever after initial improvement and for those with severe sinusitis. Amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid should be prescribed at a high dose (90 mg/kg/day, calculated based on amoxicillin, preferably in 3 daily doses). For children with a poor response to first-line therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, a second-line therapy with a combination of a second or third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime) and clindamycin is suggested. Macrolides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used in empiric treatment due to high resistance rates of pathogens responsible for acute sinusitis. According to the systematic literature review, no clinical studies comparing different therapeutic regimens in the treatment of chronic sinusitis in paediatric patients have emerged. In the absence of scientific evidence, it is not possible to formulate any specific recommendation. In children with chronic sinusitis, the drug of choice and treatment duration should be evaluated in consultation with a paediatric infectious disease specialist, taking into account previous antibiotic therapies, resistance patterns, and host-related risk factors. Due to the scarcity, heterogeneity, and poor quality of available evidence either supporting or opposing the use of systemic antibiotic therapy in children with sinusitis prospective studies on larger and more homogeneous cohort are needed.",0.9328021506976104,0.9328021506976104,0.2735245267572568,0.2735245267572568,0.8668446694305544,0.8668446694305544,0.9042035797343175,0.9042035797343175,1.0,1.0,0.8510090901591347,0.9526646052887534,0.8764229689415394,2

PMC8673850,"COVID-19: Update on Its Ocular Involvements, and Complications From Its Treatments and Vaccinations.",2021,"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) came under the attention of the international medical community when China first notified the World Health Organization of a pneumonia outbreak of then-unknown etiology in Wuhan in December 2019. Since then, COVID-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has appalled the world by spreading at a pandemic speed. Although ophthalmologists do not directly engage in the clinical care of COVID-19 patients, the ophthalmology community has become aware of the close ties between its practice and the pandemic. Not only are ophthalmologists at heightened risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure due to their physical proximity with patients in routine ophthalmic examinations, but SARS-CoV-2 possesses ocular tropism resulting in ocular complications beyond the respiratory tract after viral exposure. Furthermore, patients could potentially suffer from adverse ocular effects in the therapeutic process. This review summarized the latest literature to cover the ophthalmic manifestations, effects of treatments, and vaccinations on the eye to aid the frontline clinicians in providing effective ophthalmic care to COVID-19 patients as the pandemic continues to evolve. CONCLUSIONS The SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 when the entire world knew little of it. As the pandemic continues to evolve with the advent of new viral variants, the medical community also witnesses a boom in knowledge and information covering all facets of the pathogen.

PMC9504108,Respiratory Tract Infections and Laboratory Diagnostic Methods: A Review with A Focus on Syndromic Panel-Based Assays.,2022,"Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the focus of developments in public health, given their widespread distribution and the high morbidity and mortality rates reported worldwide. The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic or mild infection to severe or fatal disease. Rapidity is required in diagnostics to provide adequate and prompt management of patients. The current algorithm for the laboratory diagnosis of RTIs relies on multiple approaches including gold-standard conventional methods, among which the traditional culture is the most used, and innovative ones such as molecular methods, mostly used to detect viruses and atypical bacteria. The implementation of molecular methods with syndromic panels has the potential to be a powerful decision-making tool for patient management despite requiring appropriate use of the test in different patient populations. Their use radically reduces time-to-results and increases the detection of clinically relevant pathogens compared to conventional methods. Moreover, if implemented wisely and interpreted cautiously, syndromic panels can improve antimicrobial use and patient outcomes, and optimize laboratory workflow. In this review, a narrative overview of the main etiological, clinical, and epidemiological features of RTI is reported, focusing on the laboratory diagnosis and the potentialities of syndromic panels. 6. Conclusions This review focuses on the technologies used at present for the laboratory diagnosis of infectious respiratory diseases, showing that no single approach, whether it is molecular detection, antigen identification, or virus/bacteria isolation, meets the needs of all diagnostic microbiology/virology laboratories in all clinical situations involving all types of bacteria/viruses. Clinical microbiologists and virologists are challenged to use the available technology that best fits the particular situation and yields the most useful results, and should produce clinical reports that are able to guide physicians toward the right interpretation of the results for the best management of the patient. Tomorrow, as more sophisticated, yet simpler-to-use, broad-range molecular platforms become available for clinical diagnostics, bacteria cultivation and/or virus isolation in cell culture may once again become mainly a research tool. Therefore, culture- and the non-culture-based methods should be performed in parallel to optimize the differential diagnosis of viral and microbial diseases, in order to obtain useful, cost-effective, and labor-saving microbial and/or viral testing results. In determining appropriate testing algorithms for the laboratory, laboratorians must consider a wide range of factors, including the patient population (i.e., age, immune status, and comorbidities), the clinical manifestations, the physician’s diagnosis, the changing epidemiology, and time of year (i.e., many viral infections tend to be seasonal). Among the advantages and disadvantages, the cost of the molecular assays compared to that of conventional assays should be taken into account. Considering the cost per assay, syndromic panels are expensive at about EUR 100–200 per sample, allowing the detection of 14 to 27 agents per run, according to the assay. On the contrary, the culture-based assays, including MALDI-ToF identification and AST, cost about 30 Euros per sample, only allowing the detection of viable agents or cultivable agents (viruses are not yet cultivable and fastidious microorganisms are not included). The current algorithms for the diagnosis of RTIs include multiple approaches, among which molecular methods and conventional culture are the most used for laboratory diagnosis of such infectious diseases. Molecular methods are the most used for the detection of viral agents and many atypical bacteria, and their use should be routinely applied in clinical laboratories to samples from patients in the emergency department. The conventional culture remains the gold-standard for the detection of bacteria but suffers from several shortcomings. In particular, culture-based methods show lower sensitivity than molecular methods, particularly with regard to the detection of “difficult-to-grow” microbes, thus underestimating viable microorganisms in the sample to be tested. Moreover, a conventional culture is time-consuming since it requires an average of 48 to 72 h for time-to-results. Specimen-processing guidelines vary from laboratory to laboratory, resulting in the lack of a common line in the interpretation of growth bacterial patterns, with different modes of reporting the results. On the other hand, the gold-standard cell culture for the viral diagnosis of RTIs also shows several disadvantages: the need for technical expertise in evaluating the cell culture monolayers, the long incubation period required for some viruses to produce CPE, the inability of some viruses to proliferate in traditional cell cultures, and the expense involved in purchasing and maintaining cell cultures are all factors to consider when evaluating such as diagnostic workflow. The implementation of syndromic panels in the respiratory infection diagnostic algorithm has the potential to be a powerful decision-making tool for patient management, especially in emergency departments, despite requiring the appropriate use of the test in different patient populations. It is mandatory that their use is limited to symptomatic subjects, immunocompromised patients, children less than 5 years old, and the elderly, and that their use is avoided in asymptomatic subjects or mild infections. In conclusion, the use of syndromic panels for the detection of respiratory pathogens is associated with a radically reduced time-to-results and, in parallel, to increased detection of clinically relevant pathogens compared to the standard methods. Syndromic panels, if implemented wisely and interpreted cautiously, can improve antimicrobial use and patient outcomes through improved clinical decision, optimized laboratory workflow, and enhanced antimicrobial and laboratory stewardship. As the implementation of new syndromic diagnostic platforms in clinical diagnosis continues to grow, it will be essential to share experiences regarding implementation and optimization strategies. Further research is therefore needed to understand the relationship between the number of viruses/bacteria and its clinical relevance in different patient populations, as well as the true clinical significance of the simultaneous finding of multiple pathogens.",0.7091858099042302,0.7091858099042302,0.22288121560606092,0.22288121560606092,0.5191339451396135,0.5191339451396135,0.5604170227673162,0.5604170227673162,0.5731613524668671,0.4736408578554633,0.5601225581235881,0.5572178917898959,0.5593963915401651,2

PMC12290492,Welfare of beef cattle.,2025,"Abstract This Scientific Opinion provides an assessment of beef cattle welfare focusing on risks related to flooring, water access, nutrition and feeding, high environmental temperatures, lack of environmental enrichment, lack of outdoor access, minimum space allowance and mixing practices. In addition, risks related to pasture and feedlots, weaning of suckler calves, mutilations (castration, disbudding, dehorning and tail docking), and to breeding practices (hypermuscularity, dystocia and caesarean sections, polledness, maternal ability and temperament) are assessed. Decision‐making criteria for the euthanasia of cull cows are also addressed. A selection of animal‐based measures (ABMs) suitable for collection at slaughterhouses is proposed to monitor on‐farm welfare of fattening cattle. Recommendations to improve the welfare of housed fattening cattle include increasing space allowance and feeding more roughage in relation to current practice, and promoting the use of well‐managed bedded solid floors. Provision of enrichment such as brushes and roughage and an outdoor loafing area for housed cattle are recommended. Cattle kept outdoors should have access to a dry lying area and sufficient shade. Water should be provided ad libitum via large open water surfaces, and the use of nipple drinkers should be avoided. Mixing of unfamiliar cattle should be avoided and groups should be kept stable. Mutilations should be abstained from, but if carried out, a combination of analgesia and anaesthesia should be applied regardless of the calf's age. Early weaning of suckler calves should be avoided (< 6 months). Homozygous double‐muscled animals should be excluded from breeding. Selected ABMs for collection at slaughterhouses to monitor some of the highly relevant welfare consequences experienced by fattening cattle on farm are body condition, carcass fat levels, carcass condemnation, lung lesions and skin lesions. Key data gaps identified are thresholds for dietary fibre, ABM thresholds for fitness for transport and potential long‐term effects of mutilations on pain sensitisation. 3.2.1.4 Conclusions on water access Water is an essential nutrient for cattle, with water requirements varying depending on age, size of cattle, production stage, diet, feed intake and environmental conditions including temperature, humidity and solar radiation. Cattle drink water by suction at a rate of up to 24 L/min. Water troughs allow natural drinking behaviour, while water bowls have limited surface area, depth, volume and water flow. Volume and water flow are critical factors in ensuring water availability. Nipple drinkers typically have low flow rates and do not allow natural drinking behaviour (certainty > 90%). Highly relevant welfare consequences of restricted access to water are ‘prolonged thirst’, ‘group stress’ and ‘heat stress’. Prolonged thirst occurs when cattle are unable to meet their water requirements due to excessive competition or restricted access to water. Competition for water increases, leading to group stress particularly for subordinate cattle, when availability is restricted due to limited water flow, drinker size or number of drinkers. This can reduce water intake and increase the risk of injuries (certainty > 90%). For dairy cows, a minimal drinking places:animals ratio of one drinker per 10 cows or 6 cm of water trough space per cow is required to meet both their behavioural and physiological needs throughout summer and winter (certainty > 66%). Although specific data for beef cattle are lacking, this ratio is expected to suffice, given that dairy cows at the peak of lactation have higher water demands than beef cattle. Providing drinkers away from the lying area improves accessibility of drinkers (certainty > 66%). Reduced growth performance is associated with the ingestion of water contaminated with faeces, containing elevated levels of pathogenic bacteria (certainty > 90%). Water quality is reduced by the presence of nitrates, sulfates and salinity.",0.7039403692236754,0.7039403692236754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2611821107671026,0.0,0.19588658307532697,2

PMC7122655,Fever in Common Infectious Diseases,2019,"Infection of the upper airways is very common and is the most common acute illness evaluated in the outpatient setting. The infection is usually caused by viruses including rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. Influenza is the only viral infection preventable by vaccination and occurs predominately during annual winter epidemics. Bacterial infection such as acute rhinopharyngitis is uncommon and usually presents with either persistent symptoms of an URTI lasting over a week or worsening course after initial improvement or acute onset with high fever and inflammatory changes confined to the pharynx. Fever is common in both bacterial and viral gastroenteritis. High fever is commonly present in many bacterial causes (e.g. Shigella , Salmonella , Shiga toxin-producing E. coli ). Fever is often absent or low-grade in other diseases (e.g. enteropathogenic E. coli , cholera). Other febrile conditions cause diarrhoea and need to be differentiated. Fever in CNS infection is the most common presenting symptom in children beyond the neonatal age owing to the presence of inflammatory mediators, particularly IL-1 and TNF in the blood or within the CNS. In MCD, fever was the first symptom in children younger than 5 years and 94% developed fever at some point. Viral exanthems are common causes of febrile illness in children. More than 50 viral agents are known to cause a rash. Historically, exanthems were numbered in the order in which they were differentiated from other exanthems. Thus the first was measles; second, scarlet fever; third, rubella; forth, so-called Filatov-Dukes disease (no longer recognized as an entity); fifth, erythema infectiosum; and sixth, exanthema subitum.

Wild suid populations are relatively hardy and most disease research has been focused on their potential as a reservoir for diseases of concern for commercial pig production. The Togian Island babirusa, pygmy hog, Visayan warty pig, Javan warty pig, and Chacoan peccary are endangered.

PMC7185637,Understanding the symptoms of the common cold and influenza.,2005,"The common cold and influenza (flu) are the most common syndromes of infection in human beings. These diseases are diagnosed on symptomatology, and treatments are mainly symptomatic, yet our understanding of the mechanisms that generate the familiar symptoms is poor compared with the amount of knowledge available on the molecular biology of the viruses involved. New knowledge of the effects of cytokines in human beings now helps to explain some of the symptoms of colds and flu that were previously in the realm of folklore rather than medicine—eg, fever, anorexia, malaise, chilliness, headache, and muscle aches and pains. The mechanisms of symptoms of sore throat, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, nasal congestion, cough, watery eyes, and sinus pain are discussed, since these mechanisms are not dealt with in any detail in standard medical textbooks. Conclusions Our understanding of the generation of URTI symptoms has been helped by the discovery of cytokines and new knowledge about their roles in the acute phase response. URTI symptoms—eg, anorexia—that previously were in the realm of folklore now have a physiological explanation in terms of the effects of cytokines on the hypothalamus. The present rationale for the treatment of URTIs is for symptom relief, since the symptoms of URTI are perceived as a nuisance, but this review suggests that some of the symptoms are an integral part of the acute phase response and may aid in recovery from infection. The unpleasant symptoms of fever, malaise, and anorexia help to overcome infection and it is debatable whether elimination of these symptoms with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is beneficial. At present there is no evidence that symptomatic treatment of URTIs interferes with the course of the common cold or influenza but this is an area that is worthy of more research.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.8350654847024539,0.8350654847024539,1.0,1.0,0.8374069944319016,0.6453937204952992,0.8664129553922191,0.6262736250938953,0.8063781228176381,2
PMC4061890,Olfactory Hallucinations without Clinical Motor Activity: A Comparison of Unirhinal with Birhinal Phantosmia.,2013,"Olfactory hallucinations without subsequent myoclonic activity have not been well characterized or understood. Herein we describe, in a retrospective study, two major forms of olfactory hallucinations labeled phantosmias: one, unirhinal, the other, birhinal. To describe these disorders we performed several procedures to elucidate similarities and differences between these processes. From 1272, patients evaluated for taste and smell dysfunction at The Taste and Smell Clinic, Washington, DC with clinical history, neurological and otolaryngological examinations, evaluations of taste and smell function, EEG and neuroradiological studies 40 exhibited cyclic unirhinal phantosmia (CUP) usually without hyposmia whereas 88 exhibited non-cyclic birhinal phantosmia with associated symptomology (BPAS) with hyposmia. Patients with CUP developed phantosmia spontaneously or after laughing, coughing or shouting initially with spontaneous inhibition and subsequently with Valsalva maneuvers, sleep or nasal water inhalation; they had frequent EEG changes usually ipsilateral sharp waves. Patients with BPAS developed phantosmia secondary to several clinical events usually after hyposmia onset with few EEG changes; their phantosmia could not be initiated or inhibited by any physiological maneuver. CUP is uncommonly encountered and represents a newly defined clinical syndrome. BPAS is commonly encountered, has been observed previously but has not been clearly defined. Mechanisms responsible for phantosmia in each group were related to decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity in specific brain regions. Treatment which activated brain GABA inhibited phantosmia in both groups. 5. Conclusions We describe two previously underrecognized syndromes, one with cyclic unirhinal phantosmia not directly associated with hyposmia labeled CUP and one with non-cyclic birhinal phantosmia directly associated with hyposmia labeled BPAS, but both without prior or subsequent myoclonic activity. Patients with CUP reflect an uncommon clinical syndrome whereas we suggest that patients with BPAS are relatively common although they are not recognized as such by the neurological or otorhinological communities. Studies of the mechanisms related to these disorders suggest that decreased CNS GABA activity in specific brain regions is associated with phantosmia in CUP whereas changes in CNS plasticity consistent with changes observed in phantom limb sensations are associated with phantosmia in BPAS. GABA agonists, increased either by pharmacological or neurophysiological means, have been useful in inhibiting phantosmia in each patient group and suggest the relevance of levels of CNS GABA in both initiation and inhibition of these two syndromes.",0.5631809195058444,0.5631809195058444,0.0,0.0,0.3529388470096877,0.3529388470096877,0.23974191729791364,0.23974191729791364,0.41029196260555184,0.39584710441891324,0.3567640173861586,0.25922101445587503,0.3323782666535877,2

Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is often contraindicated, but emerging evidence supports its use with deltoid repair, even in patients with prior radiotherapy. This case addresses the knowledge gap in managing such complex cases. A 67-year-old right-hand dominant male reported chronic right shoulder pain worsening after a fall, with limited range of motion (active flexion 40°, abduction 40°, extension 30°), a palpable middle deltoid gap, and supraspinatus/infraspinatus wasting. History included oral carcinoma resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy 3 years prior, without metastasis. Massive IRCT of supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis with retraction (Goutallier grade 3, Hamada 4b); 4-cm retracted middle deltoid tear; rotator cuff tear arthropathy with superior humeral head migration, acromial sclerosis, and glenohumeral degeneration, confirmed by x-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Preoperative Constant-Murley score: 27 (pain: 2, activities of daily living: 10, movement: 12, strength: 2). One-stage reverse total shoulder arthroplasty with deltoid repair via deltopectoral incision extended along the anterolateral acromion. Deltoid stump reattached to acromion using transosseous sutures. Rehabilitation: 6 weeks immobilization at 90° abduction, followed by passive, active-assisted, and active range of motion exercises. At 1-year follow-up, pain resolved; active abduction/flexion improved to 165°, extension to 30°, with pain-free rotations. Postoperative Constant-Murley score: 93 (pain: 15, activities of daily living: 20, movement: 40, strength: 18). X-rays showed stable prosthesis without loosening or instability.

Despite the potential muscle atrophy-reducing and analgesic effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), evidence supporting its use in post-ARCR rehabilitation remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of home-based NMES intervention for promoting early functional recovery after ARCR. A total of 63 ARCR patients were randomized into the NMES group (n = 32) and MENS (Micro-current electrical nerve stimulation) group (n = 31), both receiving a 6-week home-based intervention (5 sessions weekly, 30 min per session) following surgery. The NMES group used neuromuscular electrical stimulation equipment, while the MENS group used identical devices without current output. The primary outcome was the Constant-Murley Shoulder (CMS) score, with secondary outcomes including resting and active visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, deltoid muscle thicknes, shoulder range of motion (ROM), muscle strength, and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia scores. Assessments were conducted preoperatively, at 6 weeks, and 3 months postoperatively. At 6 weeks postoperatively, the NMES group exhibited a significantly higher CMS than the MENS group (76.10 ± 9.43 vs. 71.22 ± 9.2 p = 0.032), along with superior active pain relief (active VAS: 4.1 ± 0.9 vs. 3.4 ± 0.7 p = 0.003), greater forward flexion ROM (151.7 ± 11.3 vs. 141.8 ± 13.6 p = 0.003), and thicker deltoid muscle thickness (1.02 ± 0.06 vs. 0.91 ± 0.06 p < 0.001). The NMES group also demonstrated lower TSK scores (31.06 ± 6.69 vs. 35.42 ± 7.76 p = 0.020) and greater adductor strength (40.9 ± 16.7 vs. 33.5 ± 12.2 p = 0.048). By 3 months postoperatively, intergroup differences persisted only in abductor ROM, muscle strength, and deltoid thickness, with no significant disparities in other measured indices. Home-based NMES effectively accelerates functional recovery, enhances pain management, and mitigates kinesiophobia within 6 weeks post-ARCR, with partial maintenance of these benefits at the 3-month follow-up. This intervention offers a safe adjunctive strategy for early rehabilitation, particularly suited to patients requiring rapid functional restoration; however, long-term efficacy remains to be confirmed.To evaluate the acceptability of MyCheck for asymptomatic sexually transmissible infections (STIs) testing.

39982019,Leptin Enhances M1 Macrophage Polarization and Impairs Tendon-Bone Healing in Rotator Cuff Repair: A Rat Model.,2025,"Rotator cuff tears are common, affecting more than 60% of individuals older than 80 years, and they have been implicated in 70% of patients with shoulder pain. M1 polarization-related inflammation has been reported to be associated with poor healing outcomes of rotator cuff injury, and leptin, an adipokine, has been reported to be a potential activator of inflammation. However, whether leptin affects rotator cuff repair remains unknown. Using in vitro cell experiments and an in vivo rat rotator cuff tear model, we therefore asked: (1) Does leptin promote the M1 polarization of macrophages in vitro and in vivo? (2) Does leptin impair biomechanical strength, the histologic structure of the tendon-bone interface, bone mineral density (BMD), or gait in the rotator cuff tear scenario? (3) Does leptin promote M1 polarization by upregulating the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway? The impact of leptin on M1 macrophage polarization in vitro was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the Western blot test, and immunofluorescence staining. The effect of leptin on tendon-bone healing was assessed in an in vivo rat rotator cuff tear model by comparing a leptin group with a suture group in terms of gait, biomechanical tensile strength, the histologic structure of the tendon-bone interface, and BMD. In the in vivo experiments, 8-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were used, adapting a previously developed rat rotator cuff tear model. The supraspinatus tendon was resected from the greater tuberosity bilaterally, and then the tendon was secured to its anatomical footprint using the transosseous single-row technique. In total, 30 rats were randomized into two groups (suture, leptin) by drawing lots (15 rats in each group). They were assessed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the surgery. In the suture group, 100 µL of normal saline was injected into the subacromial space after the deltoid muscle was restitched to the original position. In the leptin group, 100 µL of leptin solution (200 ng/mL) was injected into the subacromial space after the deltoid muscle was restitched to the original position. Biomechanical properties including maximal failure load, stiffness, and tensile failure stress were determined to assess the biomechanical strength at 4 and 8 weeks after the surgery. Histologic staining was conducted to compare the structure of the tendon-bone interface between treatment groups. Micro-MRI and micro-CT assessments were conducted to compare the overall healing outcome and BMD between treatment groups. Gait analysis was conducted to compare the stride length and strength between treatment groups. M1 macrophage polarization in vivo at the tendon-bone interface was assessed by immunofluorescence staining. Finally, to explore the underlying mechanism of the effects of leptin, Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) was used to block the TNF signaling pathway in the in vitro macrophage study, and RT-PCR and Western blot were used to explore the underlying mechanism. Leptin enhanced LPS-induced M1 polarization of macrophages in vitro, showing increased gene expression of CD86, Nos2, and TNF-α as well as increased protein expression of CD86, TNF-α, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and inducible NO synthase (iNOS). The in vivo polarization showed that the M1 polarization of macrophages at the tendon-bone interface was promoted. At 2 weeks postoperatively, there were more M1 cells in the leptin group (53 ± 5 versus 77 ± 8, mean difference 24 [95% confidence interval (CI) 11 to 37]; p = 0.002), although the proportion of M1 cells (ratio of the number of M1 cells to the total number of macrophages) was not higher (18.6% ± 2.9% versus 21.5% ± 1.7%, mean difference 2.9% [95% CI -2.8% to 8.7%]; p = 0.36). At 4 weeks postoperatively, the leptin group exhibited more M1 cells (31 ± 4 versus 50 ± 6, mean difference 19 [95% CI 6 to 32]; p = 0.008) and at a higher proportion (16.4% ± 2.6% versus 23.0% ± 3.0%, mean difference 6.6% [95% CI 0.8% to 12.4%]; p = 0.03). The in vivo experiments showed that leptin impaired tendon-bone healing. At 4 weeks postoperatively, the biomechanical properties of both groups were not different in terms of maximal failure load (12.7 ± 1.6 N versus 12.4 ± 1.8 N, mean difference -0.3 N [95% CI -2.6 to 1.8]; p = 0.91), stiffness (5.1 ± 0.7 N/mm versus 4.6 ± 0.8 N/mm, mean difference -0.5 N/mm [95% CI -1.3 to 0.5]; p = 0.44), and tensile failure stress (2.0 ± 0.3 N/mm 2 versus 2.0 ± 0.3 N/mm 2 , mean difference 0.0 N/mm 2 [95% CI -0.4 to 0.4]; p = 0.99). At 8 weeks postoperatively, the leptin group showed worse maximal failure load (17.6 ± 1.4 N versus 14.1 ± 1.4 N, mean difference -3.5 N [95% CI -5.7 to -1.3]; p = 0.002), stiffness (7.0 ± 0.6 N/mm versus 5.2 ± 0.6 N/mm, mean difference -1.8 N/mm [95% CI -2.7 to -0.9]; p < 0.001), and tensile failure stress (3.4 ± 0.3 N/mm 2 versus 2.8 ± 0.4 N/mm 2 , mean difference -0.6 N/mm 2 [95% CI -1.0 to -0.2]; p = 0.007). Results of histologic staining, image assessments, and gait analysis also demonstrated that leptin impaired the healing process. In vitro experiments showed that leptin upregulated the gene expression of molecules in the TNF pathway, including CCL2 and receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), and M1 markers, such as TNF-α, CD86, and Nos2; the addition of Nec-1 neutralized the effect of leptin on macrophage polarization, reducing the expression of M1 markers, including TNF-α, CD86, and Nos2, and blocking the TNF signaling pathway, including CCL2 and RIPK. The protein expression exhibited similar trends. Based on the results of this study, leptin appears to impair tendon-bone healing in a rat model of rotator cuff tear, promote M1 macrophage polarization at the tendon-bone interface, and upregulate the TNF signaling pathway in macrophages to promote M1 polarization. Obesity and fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscle are associated with poor healing of rotator cuff tears. In this study, the effect of leptin, an adipose factor, on tendon-bone healing and the underlying mechanism were explored. Future studies might focus on developing novel approaches to improve the tendon-bone healing in patients with obesity by targeting leptin or the TNF signaling pathway with the aid of biomaterials.",0.5130433518769418,0.5130433518769418,0.012701378824470488,0.012701378824470488,0.45310630159092347,0.45310630159092347,0.436290100427192,0.436290100427192,0.48425625741409944,0.4003499092791142,0.45162966737973276,0.36332860104634446,0.4295544007963856,4
39747784,Different patterns of neurogenic quadrilateral space syndrome: a case series of undefined posterior shoulder pain.,2025,"Quadrilateral space syndrome is a painful disorder of the shoulder caused by static or dynamic entrapment of the axillary nerve and the posterior humeral circumflex artery. It was first described in 1983; however, it is an uncommon syndrome that initially presents with nonspecific shoulder pain or selective deltoid atrophy, and diagnosis is often delayed owing to its rarity. Young athletes of overhead sports are more commonly affected by this syndrome. Symptoms of quadrilateral space syndrome include silent deltoid atrophy, persistent posterior shoulder pain, paresthesias, and tenderness over the quadrilateral space. Vascular symptoms may involve thrombosis and embolisms of the upper limb. Instrumental tests and imaging are not always conclusive, leading to frequent misdiagnosis of the syndrome. The aim of this study is to present a case series of four patients diagnosed with neurogenic quadrilateral space syndrome, describe different clinical presentations, and suggest tips for diagnosing this syndrome. All patients underwent a detailed medical history collection, were interviewed about the sports and hobbies they engaged in, and received a comprehensive clinical examination of the neck and shoulder. Patients also underwent diagnostic exams such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electromyography. An ultrasound-guided injection of local anesthetic was performed into the quadrilateral space. All patients affected by neurogenic quadrilateral space syndrome underwent conservative treatment, which included a rehabilitation program. Only one out of four patients experienced complete resolution of symptoms and did not require surgical decompression.

39593490,A novel dry needling approach treating subacromial pain syndrome to significantly improve function and reduce pain following plateau with progress using conventional physical therapy interventions: A case report.,2024,"There is limited high level research supporting the use of dry needling for mechanical shoulder pain. Dry needling is often used as an adjunct or primary treatment for musculoskeletal pain to address impairments related to muscle pain, range of motion (ROM), and strength deficits. This case study describes a 68-year-old female referred from her Physician to physical therapy (PT) with diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome. She underwent 12 sessions of traditional PT including manual therapy and therapeutic exercises with moderate pain reductions, improved ROM, and optimal functional outcomes using the Quick DASH. However, when progress was stalled, Dry needling (DN) was included in the plan of care. Dry needling was then performed as primary treatment to the anterior muscles of the shoulder (pectoralis major, pectoralis minor near the musculotendinous junction), and the latissimus, subscapularis and anterior deltoid) for two treatments resulting in significant improvements with ROM, reduced pain and improved functional outcomes which continued at 6-months with follow-up with patient.",0.3435348435671322,0.3435348435671322,0.46899842844004985,0.46899842844004985,0.6670989702881572,0.6670989702881572,0.6005146397006739,0.6005146397006739,0.7617120576454198,0.7420825381584696,0.5636861292752616,0.6553385916510829,0.5865992448692169,4
38681273,Adhesive Capsulitis Following Improper Tetanus-Diphtheria (Td) Booster Administration.,2024,"Adhesive capsulitis following vaccination is a rare complication secondary to improper intramuscular (IM) deltoid vaccine administration. It is considered a subset of the broad category known as shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA). SIRVA typically results from improper shoulder anatomic localization prior to injection, leading to erroneous placement of the needle into the glenohumeral joint capsule or subacromial space. This can trigger a wide array of pathologies, including adhesive capsulitis. We present the first known case of adhesive capsulitis following improper tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine administration. The patient, a previously healthy middle-aged female, began experiencing significant anterior left shoulder pain the day following a Td booster vaccination. She remarked receiving the injection ""higher up"" in the shoulder than normal. Over the next two weeks, she began noting significant shoulder stiffness, which was followed by a progressive loss of shoulder range of motion. Her symptoms persisted for four months without definitive diagnosis or treatment. After four months of symptoms, the patient visited an outpatient sports medicine clinic where the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis was made. Although the patient was referred for physical therapy, focusing on gentle range of motion (ROM) and stretches, followed by a planned isometric strengthening program once ROM improved, she was eventually lost to follow-up, and her recovery is unclear. Given the rarity of the diagnosis, it is unclear if adhesive capsulitis, secondary to improper IM vaccination, follows the same temporal course as ""classic"" adhesive capsulitis or results in a different timeframe of recovery.

Cohort study. Forty-eight competitive swimmers without shoulder pain (age: 18-28 years; men: 29) were followed-up for 6 months. Baseline measurements of the elastic modulus of the pectoralis minor, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, posterior deltoid, and pectoralis minor muscles were obtained using shear wave elastography. Range of motion and isometric strength were measured using a goniometer and a hand-held dynamometer, respectively. A questionnaire was administered weekly for 6 months to determine shoulder pain occurrence. Each item was compared between shoulders with and without pain at baseline. For participants with shoulder pain exceeding 2 weeks, shear wave elastography and range of motion at baseline (pre pain) and during follow-up (post pain) were compared. Of 46 swimmers followed-up for 6 months, 20 reported shoulder pain. 14 swimmers with pain were evaluated twice. Participants with shoulder pain during follow-up had significantly higher posterior deltoid and pectoralis minor stiffness at baseline and high lower extremity isometric muscle strength contralateral to the shoulder with pain compared to those without pain (p < 0.05). Swimmers with pain exceeding 2 weeks exhibited no differences in ultrasound shear wave elastography and range of motion at baseline and after pain onset.

Second, to investigate the modifying effect of pain mechanisms and pain catastrophising on the interventions' effectiveness in improving shoulder strength and disability METHODS: 200 consecutive patients were randomly allocated to usual exercise-based care or the same plus additional elastic band exercise to increase total exercise dose. Completed add-on exercise dose was captured using an elastic band sensor. Outcome measures recorded at baseline, 5 weeks, 10 weeks and 16 (primary end point) weeks included temporal summation of pain (TSP) and CPM assessed at the lower leg, pressure pain threshold at the deltoid muscle (PPT-deltoid), pain catastrophising and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index. Additional elastic band exercise was not superior to usual exercise-based care in improving pain mechanisms (TSP, CPM and PPT-deltoid) or pain catastrophising after 16 weeks. Interaction analyses showed that pain catastrophising (median split) modified the effectiveness of additional exercises (effect size 14 points, 95% CI 2 to 25), with superior results in the additional exercise group compared with the usual care group in patients with less pain catastrophising. Additional resistance exercise added to usual care was not superior to usual care alone in improving pain mechanisms or pain catastrophising. Additional exercise was, however, superior in improving self-reported disability in patients with lower levels of pain catastrophising at baseline.

36722836,Shoulder Pain and Dysfunction After Vaccination: A Systematic Review.,2023,"Persistent shoulder pain and dysfunction after vaccination are relatively rare but well-known complications after inoculations into the deltoid muscle. The term SIRVA (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration) is frequently used to encompass many of these occurrences; however, multiple distinct pathologies with similar presentations have been reported after vaccination. We performed a systematic review of the literature on vaccine-related shoulder injuries to help guide practitioners in appropriate workup and treatment based on specific diagnoses. PubMed was used to search for combinations of multiple keywords (including vaccine, immunization, SIRVA, injury, inflammation, bursitis, Parsonage-Turner syndrome, and neuritis), and all references of each potential article were reviewed. A total of 56 articles were included. Patient demographics, vaccine information, presentation, diagnostic studies, treatment, and outcomes were recorded. Diagnoses were divided into 3 categories: (1) local inflammatory reaction (SIRVA), (2) brachial neuritis, and (3) direct nerve injury. The included articles reported on 57 cases of SIRVA, 18 of brachial neuritis, and 4 of direct nerve injury. The diagnoses reported for the SIRVA cases included frozen shoulder, pseudoseptic arthritis, subacromial bursitis, rotator cuff injury, and lytic lesions of the humeral head. Various treatments were used, and most patients had resolution of symptoms with conservative treatment including physical therapy, analgesics, and/or corticosteroid injections. Advanced imaging rarely provided information that affected treatment. The brachial neuritis and direct nerve injury cases were typically confirmed with electromyography/nerve conduction studies. Treatment of these 2 categories was nonoperative in all cases, typically with analgesics and/or corticosteroids, and most patients had symptomatic improvement after a few months, with most patients regaining strength. However, some (1 of 3 patients with brachial neuritis and >1 year of follow-up and 2 of 4 patients with direct injury) had residual weakness. Medical professionals should be aware of the various pathologies that can lead to prolonged shoulder pain after vaccination. Fortunately, most of these conditions can be treated successfully with nonoperative modalities, although differentiating among the diagnoses can help guide treatment, as some likely benefit from systemic corticosteroids or localized corticosteroid injections. Outcomes for most patients have been good, with the majority recovering without residual pain or deficits.

We validated this technique using cadavers. An experienced proceduralist injected latex solution into 12 unembalmed cadaveric shoulders, aiming for the LHBTS and SS, using an ultrasound-guided injection technique that employs a single-needle entry point. An experienced surgeon dissected each specimen and graded latex location as: (1) completely accurate (in both the SS and LHBTS); (2) partially accurate (in either the SS or LHBTS); (3) accurate with overflow (in both locations, but also elsewhere); (4) partially accurate with overflow (in either location, but also somewhere else); or (5) completely inaccurate (no latex in either location). All 12 ultrasound-guided injections using the technique accurately placed latex into both LHBTS and SS (100% accuracy). Latex was also found in adjacent regions after two (17%) injections: one within the shoulder joint and one within the deltoid musculature. This newly described technique allows highly accurate access to the LHBTS and SS with single-needle entry.

35213452,"Muscle Tendon Transfers Around the Shoulder: Diagnosis, Treatment, Surgical Techniques, and Outcomes.",2022,"Muscle tendon transfers (MTTs) are effective surgical procedures for reducing pain and for improving active shoulder range of motion and patient-reported outcomes for a wide range of pathologies, including serratus anterior and trapezius muscle palsy, irreparable subscapularis tears, irreparable posterosuperior rotator cuff tears, irreparable posterior rotator cuff tears in the setting of reverse shoulder arthroplasty, and symptomatic complete deltoid deficiency. The principles of MTT include ensuring that the transferred muscle is expendable, the muscle tendon unit has similar excursion, the line of pull of the transferred tendon and of the recipient muscle are similar in terms of biomechanical force, and the transferred muscle should replace at least 1 grade of strength of the deficient recipient muscle. When MTT procedures are considered, patients must have exhausted all nonoperative management, have preserved passive range of motion, and have an understanding of the postoperative expectations and potential complications. For patients with scapulothoracic abnormal motion (STAM) due to long thoracic nerve palsy, the indirect or direct pectoralis major tendon transfer is an effective procedure for reducing pain and improving active forward elevation. For patients with STAM due to spinal accessory nerve palsy, the Eden-Lange or the triple tendon transfer procedures reduce pain and improve active forward elevation and abduction as well as patient-reported clinical outcomes. Both pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi transfer procedures for isolated irreparable subscapularis deficiency without anterosuperior humeral head escape result in improvement with respect to pain, patient-reported outcomes, and forward elevation, with the pectoralis major tendon transfer demonstrating durable long-term outcomes. The latissimus dorsi or lower trapezius tendon transfer procedures for irreparable posterosuperior rotator cuff tears reliably improve patient-reported outcomes, forward elevation, abduction, and external rotation range of motion. Additionally, latissimus dorsi transfer with or without teres major transfer can be used to restore active external rotation, both in the native shoulder and in the setting of reverse shoulder arthroplasty. The complications of MTTs include infection, hematoma, and failure of tendon transfer healing; therefore, it is recommended that these complex procedures be performed by shoulder surgeons with appropriate training.",0.5162623760452519,0.5162623760452519,0.1828266241224397,0.1828266241224397,0.8149655225437284,0.8149655225437284,0.5936753945340962,0.5936753945340962,0.8262353382208908,0.8241569377964751,0.6352864613704025,0.8083138592040573,0.6785433108288161,4
35184818,Long-term follow-up of patients with displaced scapular fractures managed surgically and non-operatively.,2022,"Controversy remains on which patients with displaced scapula fractures benefit from surgery. This retrospective cohort study aims to compare and describe long-term patient-reported outcomes of patients with displaced scapula fractures treated both surgically and conservatively. This study included patients with intra- and extra-articular scapula fractures, treated between 2010 and 2020 in a Swiss level 1 trauma centre. The decision to operate was based on standardized criteria for fracture displacement. Patients with isolated Bankart lesions (Ideberg 1) and process fractures (AO type 14-A) were excluded. Primary outcomes were functional patient reported measures (DASH score) and quality of life (EQ5D score). Secondary outcomes were complications, radiological union, satisfaction with treatment, pain and range of motion. Out of 486 cases, 74 patients had displaced scapula fractures. Forty patients were treated surgically and 34 were treated conservatively. Significantly more patients with intra-articular fractures and high-energy trauma were treated surgically. Fifty percent returned the questionnaires after a mean follow-up of 47 months (± SD 36). The mean DASH score of this group was 12 (SD 15.6), with a mean of 14.7 (SD 15.9) in the surgery group and 9.8 (SD 14.6) in the non-operative group (p = 0.7). Multivariate analysis did not show statistically significant correlating factors. No significant differences in quality of life were observed.

Complications occurred in 3/28 surgically treated patients and all three required a reoperation. In this cohort, functional results after conservative and surgical treatment were similar, despite more complex fractures and more intra-articular fractures being treated surgically.

34972555,Superior Capsular Reconstruction: Proposed Biomechanical Advantages.,2022,"The intact rotator cuff provides dynamic stability for the glenohumeral joint through range of motion by compressing the humeral head to the center of the glenoid. Maintenance of articular congruity provides a stable fulcrum for the more forceful muscles of the shoulder girdle. Massive rotator cuff tears disrupt the concavity-compression mechanism and lead to unopposed superior pull of the deltoid. As a result, superior migration of the humerus, abutment of the acromion, and, in some cases, progression to cuff tear arthropathy occur. Arthroscopic superior capsular reconstruction has emerged as an effective treatment in select indications. Several potential biomechanical advantages to SCR have been described on the basis of cadaver studies. By tethering the greater tuberosity to the glenoid, superior migration is resisted, and the center of rotation is stabilized. The interpositional spacer effect describes reduced subacromial contact pressure, and the reduction is greater with thicker grafts. Side-to-side suturing of the graft to residual tendon and capsule achieves capsular continuity and may further improve the stabilizing function of the residual capsule and prevent medial-lateral elongation of the graft. Although these biomechanical principles overlap to some degree, their summation offers an explanation for the improved pain and function seen in patients who undergo superior capsular reconstruction.",0.44398451740842726,0.44398451740842726,0.0,0.0,0.6907034302656155,0.6907034302656155,0.2650693464834169,0.2650693464834169,0.6761207855146261,0.5992306921765641,0.5002160643483947,0.7680523347906835,0.567175131958967,4
34090559,Superior Capsular Reconstruction of the Shoulder.,2021,"For irreparable rotator cuff tears, superior capsular reconstruction (SCR) has become an option for restoring glenohumeral joint stability and reversing proximal humeral migration. Signs of irreparable rotator cuff tears include pain from subacromial impingement, muscle weakness, and pseudoparalysis. In biomechanical studies, Mihata et al. showed SCR with fascia lata graft and side-to-side suturing to remaining infraspinatus tendon restored superior stability of the shoulder joint. Adding acromioplasty decreased the subacromial contact area without altering the humeral head position, superior translation, or subacromial peak contact pressure. The same research group showed that using an 8-mm thick fascia lata graft attached at 15° to 45° of shoulder abduction optimized superior stability of the shoulder joint. Adams et al. performed SCR using a dermal allograft and found that greater glenohumeral abduction angle (60°) decreased applied deltoid force. SCR can be performed with the patient in the lateral decubitus or beach chair position. Arthroscopic exploration, debridement, and infraspinatus and supraspinatus repair attempt is completed before proceeding with SCR. To restore the superior capsule of the shoulder, the graft (fascia lata autograft, dermal allograft) can be attached to the superior glenoid medially and the rotator cuff footprint on the greater tuberosity of the humerus laterally, after debriding bone to enhance healing. SCR with side-to-side suturing to the remnant rotator cuff yields promising clinical results.

Various conventional treatment modalities have been proven to help in this condition. Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) is a considerably new technique, which is being used widely for various sports related injuries for a faster recovery. This study proposes to evaluate the effect of IASTM as an added treatment for improving pain, range of motion and functional ability in patients with adhesive capsulitis. 30 shoulders were randomly allocated into two groups- Group A (IASTM + conventional treatment) and Group B (conventional treatment). Treatment was given for 12 sessions, 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks. Participants were evaluated pre treatment, post 6th session and post 12th session. Outcome measures was Numerical Pain Rating Scale, Shoulder Pain And Disability Index, Shoulder Range of Motion, Apley's scratch test.

31383627,Pressure pain hypersensitivity and referred pain from muscle trigger points in elite male wheelchair basketball players.,2020,"Shoulder injuries are common in individuals who use wheelchairs. This study investigated the presence of mechanical pain hypersensitivity and trigger points in the neck-shoulder muscles in elite wheelchair basketball players with/without shoulder pain and asymptomatic able-bodied elite basketball players. Eighteen male wheelchair basketball players with shoulder pain, 22 players without shoulder pain, and 20 able-bodied elite male basketball players were recruited. Pressure pain thresholds were assessed over C5-C6 zygapophyseal joint, deltoid muscle, and second metacarpal. Trigger points in the upper trapezius, supraspinatus, teres minor, infraspinatus, teres major, latissimus dorsi, subscapularis, pectoralis minor, pectoralis major and deltoid muscles were also examined. Wheelchair basketball players with shoulder pain showed lower pressure pain thresholds over the C5-C6 joint and second metacarpal than elite wheelchair basketball players without pain (between-groups differences: 1.1, 95%CI 0.4, 1.8 and 1.8, 95%CI 0.8, 2.8, respectively) and able-bodied basketball players without pain (between-groups differences: 0.8, 95%CI 0.4, 1.2; 1.6, 95%CI 0.8, 2.4, respectively). The mean number of myofascial trigger points for wheelchair basketball players with unilateral shoulder pain was 4.8±2.7 (2±1 active, 2.9±2.2 latent). Wheelchair basketball players and able-bodied basketball players without shoulder pain exhibited a similar number of latent trigger points (2.4±2.0 and 2.4±1.8, respectively). Wheelchair basketball players with shoulder pain exhibited higher number of active myofascial trigger points than those without pain (either with or without wheelchair), but all groups had a similar number of latent trigger points (P<0.05). The reported mechanical pain hypersensitivity suggests that active trigger points may play a role in the development of shoulder pain in elite male wheelchair basketball players.",0.21712465423557387,0.21712465423557387,0.13541274691670493,0.13541274691670493,0.4573024401149339,0.4573024401149339,0.4335239878452088,0.4335239878452088,0.5117458809669202,0.36456503168955895,0.35090246941991443,0.48700634357437517,0.3849284379585296,4
30080429,Arthroscopic Superior Capsule Reconstruction Can Eliminate Pseudoparalysis in Patients With Irreparable Rotator Cuff Tears.,2018,"Patients with pseudoparalysis and irreparable rotator cuff tears have very poor function. The authors developed a superior capsule reconstruction (SCR) technique for irreparable rotator cuff tears that restores shoulder stability and muscle balance, improving shoulder function and relieving pain. To evaluate whether arthroscopic SCR reversed preoperative pseudoparalysis in patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. One hundred consecutive patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears underwent arthroscopic SCR with fascia lata autografts; 7 patients with deltoid weakness from cervical or axillary nerve palsy and 5 with severe presurgical shoulder stiffness were excluded. The remaining 88 were allocated to 3 groups according to their preoperative active shoulder elevation: no pseudoparalysis (45 patients; mean age, 66.2 years; mean tear size, 3.5 cm), moderate pseudoparalysis (28 patients, 68.3 years, 3.5 cm), and severe pseudoparalysis (15 patients, 62.3 years, 4.9 cm). Clinical outcome, active shoulder range of motion, acromiohumeral distance, and healing rate were compared between patients with and without pseudoparalysis, as well as before surgery and at final follow-up (35-110 months). American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, active elevation, active external rotation, and acromiohumeral distance increased significantly after arthroscopic SCR among all patients. Graft healing rates did not differ among the groups ( P = .73): 98% (44 of 45) for no pseudoparalysis, 96% (27 of 28) for moderate pseudoparalysis, and 87% (13 of 15) for severe pseudoparalysis. Pseudoparalysis was reversed in 96% (27 of 28) of patients with preoperative moderate pseudoparalysis and 93% (14 of 15) with preoperative severe pseudoparalysis. Both patients with residual pseudoparalysis postoperatively (1 of 28 with preoperative moderate pseudoparalysis, 1 of 15 with preoperative severe pseudoparalysis) had graft tears. Arthroscopic SCR restored superior glenohumeral stability and improved shoulder function among patients with or without pseudoparalysis who had previously irreparable rotator cuff tears. In the absence of postoperative graft tear, arthroscopic SCR reversed preoperative pseudoparalysis. Graft healing rates after arthroscopic SCR did not differ between patients with and without pseudoparalysis.",0.23582681690376323,0.23582681690376323,0.013518459185239608,0.013518459185239608,0.4505331238063261,0.4505331238063261,0.49942697624584886,0.49942697624584886,0.5494627026571719,0.449987442016945,0.3447016891801578,0.5395770446715212,0.39342052805299865,4
30059447,Rotator Cuff Disease: Treatment Options and Considerations.,2018,"Rotator cuff disease encompasses a broad spectrum of injury and pathology with an increasing incidence with age. Pain with overhead activity, localizing to the deltoid region, and loss of active range of motion of the shoulder are among the most common presenting symptoms. Treatment options are dependent on the extent of disease and patient symptoms, and may range from physical therapy to surgical repair using a variety of possible techniques. Tear thickness, size, and morphology frequently dictate the repair techniques that are used, such as margin convergence, anterior and posterior interval slides, and mobilization of the rotator interval and supraspinatus with a subscapularis repair. Establishing and maintaining a low-tension repair is important in optimizing tendon healing after surgery. Superior capsule reconstruction is an emerging treatment strategy for massive, otherwise irreparable cuff tears, though more long-term evidence is necessary to fully evaluate this option.",0.33349136554426273,0.33349136554426273,0.0,0.0,0.9636476930053185,0.9636476930053185,0.6986169889504156,0.6986169889504156,0.9875843561206105,0.9783586499454081,0.6204829514134828,0.9948893909909609,0.7140845613078524,4
29890502,Can grip strength be used as a surrogate marker to monitor recovery from shoulder fatigue?,2018,"Muscular fatigue impacts on normal shoulder function, which is particularly pertinent to throwing athletes. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between grip strength and shoulder muscle fatigue to evaluate the role of grip strength as a surrogate measure for upper limb performance. Twenty healthy participants were recruited. EMG was recorded from 15 shoulder muscles during different fatiguing contractions: an initial baseline recording (Fat-Baseline); after a shoulder exhausting exercise regime (Fat-Exhaustion); and after a 10 min rest period (Fat-Recovery). Grip strength was similarly measured in the same conditions. Grip strength differed significantly across the testing scenarios (p = 0.012-<0.001). Greater fatigue was seen in anterior deltoid, middle deltoid, posterior deltoid and supraspinatus in the Fat-Exhaustion contraction as compared to the Fat-Baseline contraction (p = <0.001-0.043). Greater fatigue was seen during the Fat-Recovery contraction for the trapezius, serratus anterior and biceps brachii as compared to the Fat-Exhaustion contraction (p = 0.008-0.038). Grip strength decreased following an exhausting exercise protocol but recovered to baseline following a rest period. Conversely, EMG indices of fatigue did not recover. Additional fatigue was seen reflecting a reorganisation of movement strategy. Therefore, susceptibility to injury still exists if grip strength alone is used as a barometer of upper limb performance.",0.49571360052334257,0.49571360052334257,0.8951778128913025,0.8951778128913025,0.5123153899030491,0.5123153899030491,0.7365681973528434,0.7365681973528434,0.6095790819088586,0.6166670475797831,0.5675113741219168,0.5397286719418998,0.5605656985769125,4
28053746,A case report of shoulder fatigue imbalance in wheelchair rugby: implications to pain and injury.,2016,"The purpose of this case-control study was to examine potential agonist-antagonist fatigue imbalance during wheelchair rugby activity. A 16-channel NORAXON electromyography (EMG) system 1400A with telemetry was used to assess EMG activity in a 39-year-old male with a C6 complete spinal cord injury (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A), 17.5 years post injury. Mean amplitude and median frequency were determined for push-phase agonists (anterior deltoid and pectoralis major) and antagonist (posterior deltoid) across four training sessions at a community fitness and Paralympic training facility. Unlike continuous wheelchair pushing, acute muscle imbalances between agonists and antagonists (that is, push and recovery muscles) were not demonstrated. Wheelchair sports such as rugby may reduce risk of shoulder pain and overuse injury due to intermittent activity rather than continuous pushing. The current study is one of the first to document sport fatigue through electromyography during intermittent, live play rather than clinical conditions (that is, continuous pushing).",0.20819071660384433,0.20819071660384433,0.5902666434557976,0.5902666434557976,0.6710365599210736,0.6710365599210736,0.7255712841994443,0.7255712841994443,0.6800256635797006,0.6384795170252251,0.4998290627492996,0.5703437853936182,0.5174577434103793,4
25326013,Postoperative restoration of upper extremity motion and neuromuscular control during the overhand pitch: evaluation of tenodesis and repair for superior labral anterior-posterior tears.,2014,"Superior labral anterior-posterior (SLAP) tears are a common cause of shoulder pain and dysfunction in overhand throwers. Treatment outcomes remain unpredictable, with a large percentage of athletes unable to return to sport. There is considerable debate about the optimal treatment between debridement, repair, and tenodesis. Labral repair more closely restores neuromuscular control and motion during the overhand pitch than tenodesis of the long head of the biceps. Controlled laboratory study. Eighteen pitchers, including 7 uninjured controls, 6 players pitching after SLAP repair, and 5 players pitching after subpectoral biceps tenodesis (BT), underwent simultaneous surface electromyographic measurement at 1500 Hz and motion analysis at 120 Hz with a 14-camera markerless motion analysis system and high-speed video (120 Hz) to confirm accurate motion tracking. Patients had undergone surgery at least 1 year previously and had returned to pitching with a painless shoulder. No significant differences were observed in the long head of the biceps muscle, short head of the biceps muscle, deltoid, infraspinatus, or latissimus activity between controls, patients after SLAP repair, and patients after BT. The variability from pitch to pitch for each study participant was similar between groups. Based on visual inspection of the activity time plots, BT appeared to more closely restore the normal pattern of muscular activation within the long head of the biceps muscle than did SLAP repair. There were no significant differences between controls and postoperative patients in the majority of pitching kinematics; however, pitchers after SLAP repair showed significantly altered patterns of thoracic rotation (P = .034) compared with controls and were significantly less likely to fall into previously published normal values for lead knee flexion at front foot contact (P = .019). While both BT and SLAP repair can restore physiologic neuromuscular control, pitchers who undergo SLAP repair may exhibit altered patterns of thoracic rotation when compared with controls and pitchers who undergo BT. While both tenodesis and SLAP repair can restore physiologic neuromuscular control, SLAP repair may alter pitching biomechanics.",0.3648513816513775,0.3648513816513775,0.2813752606763185,0.2813752606763185,0.7593764429090604,0.7593764429090604,0.56354616800914,0.56354616800914,0.8012812388512691,0.66856349288531,0.5332215489689592,0.7448910883531765,0.5861389338150136,4

24720295,Massive irreparable rotator cuff tears: how to rebalance the cuff-deficient shoulder.,2014,"In its natural state, the shoulder is unbalanced in both the vertical and horizontal planes because the deltoid is stronger than the rotator cuff muscles and the internal rotator muscles are stronger than the external rotator muscles. With aging, this muscle imbalance can become worse, leading to tendon wear, irreversible fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscles, and upward migration of the humeral head. Most shoulders with tendon wear are functional and asymptomatic. A traumatic event (such as a fall onto the upper limb) can lead to rotator cuff tearing and a shoulder that becomes symptomatic and nonfunctional. Symptomatic massive irreparable rotator cuff tears present in one of four recognizable patterns depending on the muscular imbalance that occurs and the symptoms that are present: painful loss of active elevation, with conserved muscle balance; isolated loss of active elevation, with loss of vertical muscle balance; isolated loss of external rotation, with loss of horizontal muscle balance; and combined loss of elevation and external rotation, with loss of vertical and horizontal muscle balance. Assessing the plane of shoulder muscle imbalance is a key feature in the decision-making process. Classifying and understanding these tears allows surgeons to select the correct treatment (conservative measures, arthroscopic techniques, reverse shoulder arthroplasty, or tendon transfers) to restore shoulder balance and function.",0.3529289775812708,0.3529289775812708,0.5773698399222837,0.5773698399222837,0.9262336451859164,0.9262336451859164,0.6976222592004566,0.6976222592004566,1.0,1.0,0.6575596790017262,0.9635557014067139,0.7340586846029731,4
24077379,Characteristics of shoulder impingement in the recreational weight-training population.,2014,"Despite reports implicating subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) as an etiologic source of shoulder pain among weight-training (WT) participants, a paucity of case-controlled evidence exists to support this premise. The purpose of this study was to determine whether WT participants present with characteristics of SIS. Additionally, we investigated the role of exercise selection among those identified as having SIS. Seventy-seven (154 shoulders) men (mean age, 28) were recruited, including 46 individuals who engaged in WT a minimum of 2 days per week; and 31 controls with no history of WT participation. Before testing, participants completed a questionnaire summarizing their training patterns. On completing questionnaire, 2 previously validated tests used to identify SIS were performed on both groups and included the painful arc sign and Hawkins-Kennedy test. When clustered, these tests have a positive likelihood ratio of 5.0 for identifying SIS when compared with diagnostic gold standards. Analysis identified significant between-group differences in the combined presence of a positive painful arc and Hawkins-Kennedy (p < 0.001) test. A significant association existed between clinical characteristics of SIS (p ≤ 0.004) and both lateral deltoid raises and upright rows above 90°. Conversely, a significant inverse association was found between external rotator strengthening and characteristics of SIS. Results suggest that WT participants may be predisposed to SIS. Avoiding performance of lateral deltoid raises and upright rows beyond an angle of 90° and efforts to strengthen the external rotators may serve as a useful means to mitigate characteristics associated with SIS.",0.39502170085206645,0.39502170085206645,0.4050356348391124,0.4050356348391124,0.6327733525127447,0.6327733525127447,0.6205910573732032,0.6205910573732032,0.7340397298820303,0.6911330887396302,0.5137984937873952,0.7035113344900409,0.5612267039630566,4
22402769,Functional and clinical outcome of total shoulder arthroplasty with oversized glenoid.,2012,"The Epoca-Reconstruction-(Reco)®-Glenoid has been developed to treat patients with cuff-tear-arthropathy. The glenoid component of this system has a hemispheric shape that canopies the humeral head. This design is believed to provide a stable fulcrum and restore normal deltoid function. The purpose of this study was to analyse strengths and disadvantages of the Epoca-Reco®-Glenoid in cuff-tear-arthropathy patients. Changes in functional outcome using Constant-Murley-Scoring(CMS), CMS sub-scoring parameters and radiological outcome were analysed. For this purpose, a classification for radiologic lucency was proposed. Diverging results, influencing factors and alternative treatment options have been discussed to analyse weaknesses and enhance future development of this arthroplastic model. 23 patients aged 68 ± 8.4 years with irreparable cuff-tear-arthropathy refractory to physiotherapeutic treatment were treated with Reco-Glenoid Total-Shoulder-Arthroplasty (TSA). Pre-operative standardized evaluations included history, physical examination, radiographs, computer tomography and clinical scorings. The post-operative controls included physical examination with CMS, video documentation and radiological evaluation. After a median follow-up time of 38 ± 18 months, the CMS had been significantly improved (p < 0.001) from (17.4 ± 5.8) to (43.2 ± 19.2) points. Significant improvement in pain, activities of daily life, range of motion (p < 0.001) and power (p = 0.006) was achieved. Significantly, inferior results in functional outcome and higher lucency rates were observed in female patients and in patients treated with small glenoid components. The follow-up rate was 100 %. The semi-constraint reconstruction glenoid prosthesis model in cuff-tear-arthropathy patients significantly improves shoulder function, however, it yields controversial results, with satisfactory results in male and poor results in female patients. Revision rate of the female cohort and loosening of the glenoid component in this short-term follow-up is of concern. Further investigations taking BMD, osteopenic conditions and influence of surface area in smaller individuals into consideration are recommended, to determine whether this is the underlying cause of the inferior results in females.",0.5303606693137903,0.5303606693137903,0.22801330466364517,0.22801330466364517,0.34377413666775164,0.34377413666775164,0.23749210632983703,0.23749210632983703,0.4462723629137667,0.4001562629324607,0.3683011210195098,0.45503222017834977,0.38998389580921977,4

This disease has uncommonly been found after elective open shoulder surgery but extremely seldom after minimally invasive surgery.

20049573,Indications for reverse total shoulder arthroplasty in rotator cuff disease.,2010,"Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) was introduced to treat rotator cuff tear arthropathy but is now used to treat a variety of problems. Although its use has expanded substantially since the FDA's approval in 2004, the appropriateness in patients with rotator cuff disease is unclear. We review the use of RTSA in patients with rotator cuff disease to (1) describe classification of rotator cuff tear reparability and the concept of a balanced shoulder; (2) explore the theory behind RTSA design relative to rotator cuff arthropathy; (3) discuss the indications and contraindications for RTSA; and (4) review published outcomes of RTSA for rotator cuff arthropathy. We performed a selective review of the literature on the use of RTSA in the treatment of rotator cuff disease. Modern RTSA designs restore deltoid tension and a functional fulcrum to the rotator cuff deficient shoulder, which allows recovery of active shoulder elevation and effectively restores function in short- and medium-term followup studies. In short-term followup the RTSA relieves symptoms and restores function for patients with cuff tear arthropathy and irreparable rotator cuff tears with pseudoparalysis (preserved deltoid contraction but loss of active elevation). Severely impaired deltoid function, an isolated supraspinatus tear, and the presence of full active shoulder elevation with a massive rotator cuff tear and arthritis are contraindications to RTSA. For properly selected patients who have symptomatic and disabling rotator cuff deficiency, RTSA can result in life-changing improvements in pain, motion, function, and patient satisfaction.

21509101,Bilateral functional thoracic outlet syndrome in a collegiate football player.,2009,"Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) involves compression of the brachial plexus, subclavius artery and vein. Many studies discuss efficacy of surgery and few discuss conservative treatment. It is unknown what specific forms of conservative treatment are best. Describe conservative management for TOS using unique exercises. A collegiate football player reported numbness/tingling down his right arm after a right brachial plexus stretch injury. Seven months later, he was diagnosed with recurrent cervical traction neuropraxia. Two months later, he reported bilateral symptoms and was diagnosed with functional TOS. The athlete began shoulder strengthening (deltoid, middle trapezius, rhomboids, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, biceps, upper trapezius and rotator cuff) and stretching (pectoralis, scalene and upper trapezius) which failed to resolve his symptoms after four weeks. Surgical resection of bilateral first ribs and quitting football was recommended by four physicians. Unique therapeutic exercises developed by the Postural Restoration Institute™ were used to optimize respiration/posture via muscle activation and inhibition. After six weeks, the athlete was asymptomatic and returned to football but still experienced paresthesia with contact. Additional exercises were prescribed and remaining symptoms were abolished. The Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire was 55.5% at initial and 0% at four weeks and discharge. Athlete did not demonstrate relief of symptoms from shoulder stretching and strengthening. Intervention designed to optimize respiration/posture by repositioning the pelvis/trunk via specific muscle inhibition and activation resulted in abolishing the athlete's symptoms. Management that aims to optimize respiration via muscle inhibition, activation, and repositioning warrants further research.",0.538142869543395,0.538142869543395,0.17084097944314863,0.17084097944314863,0.5887121181142041,0.5887121181142041,0.5520560754903447,0.5520560754903447,0.6500862015287884,0.6726633971699588,0.5059192876312767,0.6490650960435291,0.5417057397343399,4
19332402,Iliac bone-block autograft for posterior shoulder instability.,2009,"Posterior shoulder instability is a rare condition, representing only 4% of all shoulder-joint instabilities. Numerous surgical techniques are used to treat it when conservative functional treatment proves to be insufficient. This retrospective study relates to 8 patients, presenting recurrent posterior shoulder instability, all treated with a posterior iliac bone-block procedure. The results were assessed both clinically and with contemporary imaging techniques. A unique identical surgical technique was used in all these cases including a posterior deltoid head detachment, an infraspinatus muscle dissociation and a bone-block positioning intended to extend and enlarge the glenoid cavity rather than to act as an actual block. Seven of these 8 cases were posttraumatic (including 2 with a concomitant congenital hyperlaxity past history) and the non-traumatic 1 was secondary to an epileptic seizure episode. All the patients had a typical posterior shoulder instability clinical presentation in the form of recurrent true dislocation incidents. In 6 cases, imaging revealed lesions of the humeral head or the glenoid cavity. These lesions were displacement-related anterior impaction defects of the humeral head (McLaughlin lesion) and/or a fracture (or erosion) of the posterior glenoid rim. Mean postoperative follow-up was 34 months. No cases of postoperative suprascapular nerve deficit were observed. All patients recovered normal joint range of motion in abduction and anterior elevation; in 3 patients, however, external rotation ended up being limited by an average 20 compared to the opposite side. The mean Constant score was 96.25 points and the mean Duplay score 90. Only 4 patients were able to return to their preoperative sports activity level. Three required an additional procedure, 2 for hardware removal and 1 for posterior deltoid repair, which all lead to an uneventful evolution. Imaging at follow-up (X-ray or CT) did not show any instance of bone-block pseudoarthrosis or osteolysis nor did it exhibit glenohumeral early degenerative changes. In all, at a mean 3 years' follow-up, the present series showed satisfactory results in 80% of cases. A literature review found comparable results for bone-block stabilization procedures. No recurrences of instability are reported with this technique, the main difficulty of which residing in the correct positioning of the bone-block. The stabilizing efficacy and low subsequent arthritic changes of the iliac posterior bone-block graft procedure seem thus confirmed by these encouraging results. The iliac posterior shoulder bone-block is effective in managing instances of involuntary posterior shoulder instability. A review of the literature confirmed these satisfactory results in terms of non-recurrence, pain relief and function recovery with this technique; the main difficulties of this technique remains in the correct positioning of the bone-block and the proper orientation of the fixation screws.",0.6097682159090193,0.6097682159090193,0.12740133998781472,0.12740133998781472,0.5114556622549543,0.5114556622549543,0.467440288689599,0.467440288689599,0.6357649780778141,0.6167543202038613,0.48405007434376496,0.5957991583427621,0.5119873453435142,4
19226059,Salvage procedure for chronic acromioclavicular dislocation subsequent to overzealous distal clavicle resection.,2008,"This article presents our surgical technique for reestablishing acromioclavicular stability after overzealous distal clavicular resection. Two cases are presented in which the clavicle of the affected acromioclavicular joint was unstable, causing pain with range of motion (ROM). To address the pathology, reconstruction of the coracoclavicular ligament and reattachment of the trapezius and deltoid to the clavicle were required. We reconstructed the coracoclavicular ligaments using an Achilles tendon calcaneal allograft. The bony end of the Achilles tendon allograft was used as an extension to lengthen the clavicle and the tendinous portion to reconstruct the coracoacromial ligament, thus stabilizing the clavicle. Once allograft reconstruction and stability had been achieved, a 1.5-cm gap remained between the acromion and the new allograft end of the clavicle. There was no evidence of acromioclavicular impingement. Supplemental fixation was not required. The trapezius, pectoralis, and deltoids were all reefed over the clavicle using Vicryl sutures (Ethicon, Inc, West Somerville, New Jersey) to reinforce the reduction and restore the natural contour of the shoulder girdle. Fifteen months postoperatively, both patients had maintained a reduced acromioclavicular joint. They had no pain with ROM, and full muscular strength was evident in all planes. Radiographs of their shoulders revealed a completely incorporated graft and a reduced clavicle. We recommend this novel technique for reestablishing acromiclavicular stability, as it provides good functional and subjective results.",0.5847633099960161,0.5847633099960161,0.419261104024262,0.419261104024262,0.45322181994645583,0.45322181994645583,0.3751256933493343,0.3751256933493343,0.6348908647710582,0.5264535066412996,0.47156252828804196,0.5865324370145908,0.5003050054696792,4
19180225,Rhabdomyolysis of the deltoid muscle in a bodybuilder using anabolic-androgenic steroids: a case report.,2009,"Rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) may be caused by mechanical, physical, chemical, or biological factors. We present the unique case of a bodybuilder who developed localized rhabdomyolysis of the deltoid muscle after injection of steroids into the shoulder region. A 39-year-old amateur bodybuilder presented to the emergency department with excruciating pain and inability to move his right shoulder after injecting stanozolol, an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS), into his right deltoid muscle on the same day. On physical examination, the right deltoid muscle was swollen and tense and the surrounding skin red, tender, and warm. He had no fluctuation or systemic fever and no sensory or motor deficit. His distal pulsations were distinct. Laboratory test results suggested massive rhabdomyolysis. The major magnetic resonance imaging finding was diffuse hyperintensity signals on T2-weighted images of the deltoid muscle, which was consistent with edema. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis, mild injury, infectious myositis without phlegmon or abscess formation, radiation therapy, subacute denervation, compartment syndrome, early myositis ossificans, rhabdomyolysis, and sickle cell crisis. The patient was treated with intravenous fluid replacement and sodium bicarbonate to alkalinize the urine. Four days after admission, his pain had decreased, he had regained range of motion, and his renal function remained unaffected. Anabolic-androgenic steroid use is associated with various side effects that are generally systemic and dose related. We could not find reports of localized side effects of AAS use, as this case presented, elsewhere in the English-language literature. ""Doping"" among amateur athletes occurs frequently. It can cause acute and chronic health problems, most of which are systemic. This is the first description of localized rhabdomyolysis in the area of an AAS injection.",0.7232092584598383,0.7232092584598383,0.476255397125084,0.476255397125084,0.82095196066276,0.82095196066276,0.6121925143707269,0.6121925143707269,0.8143861205737959,0.8959980900193572,0.6986599654491561,0.6264991317431374,0.6806197570226513,4
18592217,The use of split deltoid-flap in the treatment of massive rotator cuff defects: a retrospective study of 61 patients.,2008,"Massive and irreparable rotator cuff tears are a challenge for the orthopaedic surgeon. The purpose of this study was to report our experience with the treatment of massive and irreparable defects of the rotator cuff with a modified deltoid split transfer. Between 1996 and 2004, for all patients suffering from full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff (> 5 cm tears in diameter, involving two or more tendons) were operated with a modified deltoid split transfer. A total of 61 patients (39 females and 22 males; age 61.9: range 49-75 years) were operated. Duration of symptoms before surgery averaged 9.6 months (range 3.5-14 months). The patients were followed for an average of 46 months (range 24-64 months). The operation included an arthroscopic evaluation, acromioplasty with resection of the lateral clavicular end, resection of the acromioclavicular joint and where necessary biceps tenodesis. The cuff defect was repaired by transfer of half thickness anterior deltoid-flap (3 cm x 5 cm) into the defect. All patients were evaluated both preoperatively and postoperatively with regard to pain, ability to perform activities of daily life, range of motion, strength and satisfaction. The patients subjectively rated their results--49 (80%) excellent or good outcome, seven moderate and five poor. Preoperatively, the Constant amounted 33.5 +/- 7.74 points. At follow-up, the score significantly increased to 77.57 +/- 19.74 points. The acromiohumeral distance increased from 5.1 +/- 1.4 mm to 9.1 +/- 1.5 mm. Pain free flexion improved from an average 90 degrees to an average 165 degrees (P < 0.01), and abduction improved from an average 110 degrees to an average 160 degrees (P < 0.01). The mean external rotation increased from 40 degrees to 65 degrees (P < 0.01), and internal rotation increased from 50 degrees to 70 degrees (P = 0.06). In the MRI and ultrasound examination, all patients had intact flap, except the three patients with flap necrosis. There were eight complications--three haematomas, two superficial wound infections which did not influence the outcome, and three fibrotic transformation after an early aseptic necrosis of the deltoid flap, which were re-operated. This technique is easy to perform, and it is possible to obtain a satisfactory outcome after repair of massive tears of the rotator cuff. A substantial decrease of pain, increased stability, an increase range of motion and strength can be achieved, with proper rehabilitation.",0.5120665606371475,0.5120665606371475,0.5650228480746177,0.5650228480746177,0.6776258540515836,0.6776258540515836,0.5456435130175445,0.5456435130175445,0.8348040074689358,0.8464584993867746,0.5859187785612003,0.7249847563526356,0.6206852730090592,4
18254085,Surgery for rotator cuff disease.,2008,"This review is one in a series of Cochrane reviews of interventions for shoulder disorders. To determine the effectiveness and safety of surgery for rotator cuff disease. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Sports Discus, Science Citation Index (Web of Science) in March 2006 unrestricted by date or language. Only studies described as randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials (RCTs) studying participants with rotator cuff disease and surgical interventions compared to placebo, no treatment, or any other treatment were included. Two independent review authors assessed methodological quality of each included trial and extracted data. We included 14 RCTs involving 829 participants. Eleven trials included participants with impingement, two trials included participants with rotator cuff tear and one trial included participants with calcific tendinitis. No study met all methodological quality criteria and minimal pooling could be performed. Three trials compared either open or arthroscopic subacromial decompression with active non operative treatment (exercise programme, physiotherapy regimen of exercise and education, or graded physiotherapy strengthening program). No differences in outcome between these treatment groups were reported in any of these trials. One trial which also included a placebo arm (12 sessions detuned soft laser) reported that the Neer score of participants in both active treatment arms improved significantly more than those who received placebo at six months. Six trials that compared arthroscopic with open subacromial decompression reported no significant differences in outcome between groups at any time point although four trials reported a quicker recovery and/or return to work with arthroscopic decompression. Adverse events, which occurred in three trials and included infection, capsulitis, pain, deltoid atrophy, and reoperation, did not differ between surgical groups. Based upon our review of 14 trials examining heterogeneous interventions and all susceptible to bias, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of surgery for rotator cuff disease. There is ""Silver"" (www.cochranemsk.org) level evidence from three trials that there are no significant differences in outcome between open or arthroscopic subacromial decompression and active non-operative treatment for impingement.

18066578,Effects of experimental muscle pain on shoulder-abduction force steadiness and muscle activity in healthy subjects.,2008,"We previously demonstrated that the steadiness of shoulder abduction is reduced in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS), which might be related to shoulder pain associated with the SIS. The aim of the present study was to examine the acute effects of experimental shoulder muscle pain on shoulder motor function in healthy subjects. The fluctuations in exerted force (force steadiness) and electromyographic (EMG) activity from eight shoulder muscles were determined during sub-maximal isometric and dynamic contractions with the shoulder abductors in nine healthy subjects (27.7 +/- 4.2 years, mean +/- 1 SD) before, during and after experimental pain induction. Experimental pain was induced by bolus injections of 6% hypertonic saline into the supraspinatus muscle. Experimental muscle pain reduced shoulder-abduction force steadiness on average by 21% during isometric contractions (P = 0.012) and tended to do so during concentric contractions (P = 0.083). Middle deltoid, and infraspinatus and lower trapezius muscle activity increased (3-5% EMG(max)) during isometric and concentric contractions, respectively (P < 0.05). Thus, experimental shoulder muscle pain reduced the steadiness of isometric shoulder abduction and caused small changes in the abduction activation strategy. The observed effects of experimental pain on shoulder motor function differed from that observed previously in patients with SIS and chronic pain during the same types of contractions. A possible explanation may be that, even though the adopted experimental pain-paradigm may reflect the SIS in terms of the painful structures, it might not reflect the adaptations in the central nervous system seen with chronic pain.",0.49023347395618294,0.49023347395618294,0.3442241062486743,0.3442241062486743,0.5873892751029627,0.5873892751029627,0.5584190411474909,0.5584190411474909,0.6622077894221682,0.5327057034524636,0.50266627785624,0.6044159284701867,0.5281036905097267,4

15930537,Open rotator cuff repair without acromioplasty.,2005,"In most clinical reports on rotator cuff repair, acromioplasty was done as part of the procedure. In this prospective study, we evaluated the hypothesis that rotator cuff repair without acromioplasty would result in a substantial improvement in shoulder comfort and function. Ninety-six consecutive primary repairs of full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff were performed through a deltoid-muscle-splitting incision that preserved the integrity of the coracoacromial arch and the deltoid insertion. All patients were invited to participate in a prospective study involving periodic self-assessment of shoulder function with the Simple Shoulder Test and general health status with the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire, both of which are validated instruments. Sixty-one patients provided follow-up information for at least two years postoperatively, and the average duration of follow-up was five years. Thirty-four of the tears involved the supraspinatus tendon alone; sixteen involved the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons; and eleven involved the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis tendons. The percentage of shoulders that could be used to perform each of the twelve functions on the Simple Shoulder Test was significantly increased postoperatively (p < 0.002). Men and women had different degrees of function preoperatively (p < 0.00000001) and postoperatively (p < 0.001), but the improvement in function was essentially identical for the two genders. The mean improvement in the number of shoulder tests that could be performed was best for the patients with one-tendon tears (4.9 tests), next best for those with two-tendon tears (3.6 tests), and worst for those with three-tendon tears (3.3 tests). SF-36 scores for physical role (p < 0.003) and comfort (p < 0.0001) were significantly improved postoperatively. Significant improvement in self-assessed shoulder comfort and in each of the twelve shoulder functions was observed after rotator cuff repairs performed without acromioplasty.

14668495,Thermal capsular shrinkage for treatment of multidirectional instability of the shoulder.,2003,"Capsular laxity is the main pathology in patients with multidirectional instability, and thermal shrinkage has been commonly employed to treat this condition. The objective of this study was to evaluate thermal capsular shrinkage as a treatment of multidirectional instability of the shoulder. Nineteen consecutive patients with multidirectional instability were treated with thermal shrinkage. Fifteen patients had involuntary instability, and four had voluntary instability. The predominant direction of the instability was anteroinferior in ten patients and posterior in five; four patients had instability in multiple directions. Patients were followed for a minimum of two years or until surgical failure and recurrence of symptoms. Postoperatively, the patients wore a sling for three weeks, and they were evaluated regularly at three, six, and twelve months. The Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index as well as subjective and objective evaluations of the patient's function, range of motion, pain, and instability were used as clinical outcome measures. Nine patients had recurrence of the instability at an average of nine months (range, seven to fourteen months) following the surgical procedure. Four patients had sensory dysesthesias in the axillary nerve distribution, and one of them had deltoid weakness. All neurological symptoms resolved within nine months. The surgical procedure failed in the five patients with predominantly posterior instability. It failed in only two of the ten patients with predominantly anteroinferior instability, and overall this group had objective improvement. Thermal capsular shrinkage used to treat multidirectional instability had a substantial failure rate with associated postoperative complications, including recurrence of instability (nine of the nineteen patients), stiffness (five patients), and neurological symptoms (four patients).",0.3724661499291103,0.3724661499291103,0.3863295298783674,0.3863295298783674,0.41750743211618235,0.41750743211618235,0.5623635994846812,0.5623635994846812,0.47802437229928707,0.4880472730543607,0.4010403414233842,0.5284632668784588,0.4328960727871528,4

This may cause pain and lead to impingement syndrome and rotator cuff tearing. After sustaining a direct blow to the right shoulder, a male division I basketball player was diagnosed with impingement syndrome and an os acromiale. Following failed conservative treatment, the athlete underwent arthroscopic subacromial decompression & debridement of the loose os acromiale in the right shoulder.

Arthroscopic repair of the unstable type II SLAP lesion, together, with arthroscopic subacromial decompression, and resection of the os acromiale was performed on the left shoulder. Both surgeries were successful and the athlete was able to return to competition subsequent to completing a progressive shoulder rehabilitation program.

12716007,The reoperation of failed rotator cuff repairs.,2003,"Operative management of a failed primary rotator cuff repair is very difficult, and the results are also less satisfactory. In order to identify which factors are responsible for the failure of the initial surgery and which factors are correctable with reoperation, the results of surgical treatment for failed initial rotator cuff repair were analyzed. Twenty patients with a previous repair of the rotator cuff received a second operation for pain and functional impairment. The second repair was performed with an average interval of 11.8 months from the primary repair. The average follow-up was 60.7 months and the results were rated on the basis of pain, range of motion and function. Multiple factors accounted for the failure of initial surgery: large to massive tear at the time of previous repair (80%), persistent subacromial impingement (75%), poor condition of the deltoid muscle (35%), rupture of the long head of biceps tendon (25%), poor quality of cuff tissue (25%) and severe subacromial or intra-articular adhesion (20%). After reoperation, 15 patients (75%) had pain free or occasional aching soreness. Eleven patients (55%) had active forward elevation over 120 degrees, while the average preoperative motion was 80 degrees and the postoperative motion was 127 degrees. Twelve patients (60%) had no functional impairment or were left with some restriction. Over-all satisfactory results were noted in eleven patients (55%). The most common factors associated with the failure of the initial repair were large to massive tear and inadequate acromioplasty. Most factors could be avoided at the initial repair, while several factors such as irreparable massive tear, poor deltoid function and poor cuff tissue were very difficult to be corrected at the repeat repair. The primary goal should be relief of pain instead of functional improvement.

12690552,[EMG analysis of shoulder muscles during preventive and therapeutic exercise in the overhead athlete].,2003,"Strengthening of the rotator cuff muscles in functional positions is one of the important demands in the prevention and rehabilitation of overhead athletes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of a new shoulder bar (SBT 1000) on the myoelectric activity of the deltoid muscle. Subjects included 12 healthy overhead athletes (control group) and 9 overhead athletes with subacromial pain syndrome (test group). Both groups performed bilateral internal and external shoulder rotations against resistance from a pulley. The position of 90 degrees abduction and elbow flexion was passively supported with the SBT 1000 and had to be actively hold without the SBT 1000. The electromyographic activity of the three heads of the deltoid was determined using surface electrodes. Rectified mean EMG data were analysed by three factor repeated measures ANOVA (group x bodyside x condition). Significant differences (p < 0,05) occurred between the conditions with and without SBT 1000 in all three heads of the deltoid. The percentage of reduction of muscle activity with the SBT 1000 in the dominant arm was 33 %, 29 % and 17 % for the anterior, middle and posterior head. No significant differences could be shown between control and test group or between the dominant and nondominant arm. With the SBT 1000 rotational shoulder exercise can be performed in a functional position with reduced involvement of the deltoid, which could be beneficial in prevention and rehabilitation of overhead athletes.",0.5913856490566448,0.5913856490566448,0.33989572617008473,0.33989572617008473,0.6677787068268587,0.6677787068268587,0.5969696290228295,0.5969696290228295,0.6210725112668659,0.6991928477547412,0.5708380455767659,0.5792026201964535,0.5729291892316878,4

We evaluated retrospectively the results of our patients who underwent arthroscopic-assisted mini-open rotator cuff repair. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression and mini-open repair were performed in 31 patients (8 males, 23 females; mean age 54.3 years; range 38 to 71 years) with rotator cuff tear in which the tendon tear had not been excessively retracted (till glenoid) and the muscle had not undergone fatty degeneration. Patients below 40 years of age were considered for surgery, while those between 40 to 60 years were initially treated with a rehabilitation program to relieve pain and gain motion before surgery. Surgery was reserved until after failure with a three-month rehabilitation program in patients above 60 years. Evaluations were based on physical and radiographic examinations and Constant scores. The mean follow-up period was 24.4 months (range 12 to 37 months). Twenty-five patients (81%) achieved excellent or good results and six patients (19%) had satisfactory results. The mean Constant score was 84.6. One patient developed joint stiffness unresponsive to conservative treatment. Arthroscopic capsular release followed by a heavy exercise program enabled him to return to his former sports activity level within three months. Arthroscopic-assisted repair is a superior alternative in rotator cuff surgery in selected cases because it enables the shoulder surgeon to preserve deltoid attachment and to prepare the torn tendon for an easy repair.

Complete removal of the acromion had produced severe shoulder abnormality with pain and joint stiffness. We present the operative technique of acromion reconstruction using a corticocancellous bone graft from the iliac crest. Recreation of the acromion as a fulcrum of the shoulder joint as well as an important physiological insertion area for the deltoid muscle markedly improved pain and range of motion in these patients.

10652666,Repair of the rotator cuff. Mini-open and arthroscopic repairs.,2000,"The repair of rotator cuff tears by traditional open subacromial decompression and rotator cuff tendon reapproximation has proved successful in restoring function and decreasing pain, but open rotator cuff repair has some inherent disadvantages. Postoperative detachment of the deltoid repair has been reported and results in significant morbidity. The open technique may also require a longer period of limited motion resulting in greater stiffness. Arthroscopically assisted mini-open repairs and, more recently, completely arthroscopic repairs of the rotator cuff have been developed and increasingly are being applied. Both techniques avoid detachment of the deltoid. The mini-open and arthroscopic approaches to rotator cuff repair have the added benefit of arthroscopic evaluation of the glenohumeral joint. The mini-open technique has the advantage of allowing the direct visualization of the cuff repair and allows surgeons to place the stitches in an open fashion, which is familiar to all surgeons. The mini-open technique also allows the placement of tension-absorbing stitches in the rare cases that they are needed. Mini-open techniques also allow the choice of bone anchors or osseous tunnels for fixation. The completely arthroscopic cuff repair has several potential advantages over the open and mini-open cuff repair techniques; first is the decreased disruption of the soft tissues, which may result in less scarring and adhesions. The procedure is the most cosmetically appealing of the techniques. Reduced postoperative pain is also cited as an advantage but has been demonstrated only in a single, nonrandomized study. Finally, if technical difficulties arise, the conversion to a mini-open repair can be done easily. In a few studies, arthroscopic cuff repair techniques have shown promise as an alternative to mini-open or open repair, but these results have been at the hands of a few surgeons who have extensive experience in arthroscopy of the shoulder. In contrast, the mini-open procedure requires modest arthroscopic skills and has a documented history of success. Nevertheless, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is a viable and effective technique in the hands of surgeons with adequate skills, and this procedure is likely to become more commonly performed in the future as shoulder arthroscopic skills and instrumentation improve.",0.6888584011464113,0.6888584011464113,0.3209818473868051,0.3209818473868051,0.7146191837366995,0.7146191837366995,0.38884681874740734,0.38884681874740734,0.7560709374618128,0.8073627946545971,0.60592878787101,0.7450440313088221,0.640707598730463,4

8504591,The treatment of posterior subluxation in athletes.,1993,"Posterior instability in athletes is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Athletes have recurrent posterior subluxations rather than true dislocations, and they have pain rather than instability, which makes the diagnosis difficult. The pathology is usually capsular laxity rather than a true reverse Bankart lesion. There is not one diagnostic test, including computed tomography (CT) arthrogram, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or arthroscopy, that will always help with the diagnosis. Most athletes respond to conservative care with an exercise program designed to strengthen the posterior deltoid, the infraspinatus, and the teres minor; but, there is still a select group of athletes that cannot perform their sport after an extensive rehabilitation program. The surgical options for these athletes are varied, and the results in most cases are less than ideal. A posterior capsulorrhaphy was performed to treat this problem. This was initially performed with a staple, but this technique has been abandoned for a suture capsulorrhaphy to avoid staple problems. The 40 athletes treated operatively that had adequate follow-up evaluation reflected a 40% failure rate. Most of the failures were related to ligamentous laxity and unrecognized multidirectional instability not treated at the time of surgery. There may be subtle differences between a patient with posterior subluxation and multidirectional instability; these must be differentiated before operation. Also, the higher the competitive level of athlete, the worse the overall results. The high-level athlete must be informed that even if his or her shoulder is stabilized, the functional results may not allow him or her to continue at the same competitive level.",0.729463034069786,0.729463034069786,0.3525428319655411,0.3525428319655411,0.8914118045491721,0.8914118045491721,0.5149383312365965,0.5149383312365965,0.8939125153046683,0.917234219909143,0.7081384948940503,0.8908102053087024,0.7538064224977135,4

Shoulder flexors, internal and external rotator muscles were trained three times a week, during a period of 8 weeks. At follow-up one year after completion of the specific training program all shoulders except five were improved. Five shoulders had remaining instability. Four of these patients had generalized joint laxity and a much decreased humeral head retroversion, and were later on stabilized with a rotational osteotomy of the proximal humerus. One of the shoulders with remaining instability was of traumatic type with normal skeletal anatomy. This patient was later on stabilized with a Putti-Platt procedure. We conclude that most of the patients were relieved from pain, and had decrease or cessation of their dislocations.

PMC12325834,Management of Posterior Shoulder Instability Among Football Players.,2025,"Purpose of Review Football players are at an increased risk for posterior shoulder instability compared to other sports due to certain sport-specific motions that involve posteriorly directed force on the shoulder in a vulnerable position. Management of posterior instability, both nonoperative and operative, is aimed at preventing recurrent instability. Regardless of treatment, timing of return to play revolves around avoiding reinjury and prioritizing player safety. This article provides a review of the current treatment modalities of posterior shoulder instability and the return to play criteria that must be met prior to releasing the player to competition. Recent Findings Posterior shoulder instability was traditionally thought to occur predominately in offensive linemen. However, recent literature suggests it can also commonly be found in other players, including defensive linemen and quarterbacks. Current research reports high return to play rates for athletes that undergo arthroscopic posterior capsulolabral repair. Whereas, there is limited literature regarding return to play rates after posterior bony augmentation and management of reverse Hill-Sachs lesions. Rehabilitation and return to play protocols have been recommended but are nonspecific to American football. Summary Posterior shoulder instability has the potential to sideline young athletes for an extended time and presents a complex challenge to both the athlete and the treating physician. Although the ultimate goal is to facilitate return to play, the physician must balance this with minimizing the risk of re-injury. Conclusion Posterior shoulder instability is an expanding area of research. Players most at risk for posterior shoulder instability and posterior labrum tears are those that endure posterior directed force on the shoulder while it’s in a vulnerable position. Although operative intervention is generally more favorable in this population, few games are missed during the season due to posterior shoulder instability when managed non-operatively. After surgical intervention, there is a high rate of return to play typically after 4 months of recovery and rehabilitation. Recurrent posterior shoulder instability is associated with increased GBL, although a definitive threshold for bone grafting is not yet known.Future research should consider treatments that can tolerate the demands of the sport, incorporate the athlete’s pathoanatomy and position specific demands, as well as develop more precise and distinct functional outcome methods.",0.781264354897876,0.781264354897876,0.12180089609555067,0.12180089609555067,0.5657787431624319,0.5657787431624319,0.7618499912221359,0.7618499912221359,0.7410075735901365,0.856273066106152,0.6506309872927972,0.6204684888742855,0.6430903626881692,4
PMC12317797,Elite Tennis Players with a Weak Rotator Cuff: The Paradox of Infraspinatus Atrophy - A Clinical Commentary and Practical Approach.,2025,"Infraspinatus atrophy (IA) is a prevalent but often overlooked condition in elite tennis players, resulting from suprascapular nerve (SN) dysfunction due to repetitive traction or compression. While many athletes maintain normal biomechanics through compensatory mechanisms, these adaptations can lead to kinetic chain imbalances, increasing the risk of secondary injuries. Early detection is crucial to preventing long-term structural changes. Diagnosis involves visual inspection, palpation, and functional tests, though ultrasound imaging offers a more objective assessment of infraspinatus muscle thickness. Conservative treatment aims to restore mobility, strength, and neuromuscular control. Athletes should initially avoid aggravating movements before gradually reintroducing overhead activity. Preventing posterior capsule stiffness through targeted stretching reduces SN compression risk, while nerve gliding exercises enhance mobility. Strengthening programs should prioritize controlled eccentric loading of the infraspinatus and scapular control exercises to improve stability and reduce compensatory strain on surrounding muscles. Preventive strategies are similar to rehabilitation approaches and should be incorporated into training routines, particularly for young athletes. Structured progression in strength training and workload management is essential to prepare the shoulder for high-impact movements like serving. Further research is needed to investigate the relationship between IA and athletic performance, including serve speed and injury risk. This clinical commentary presents a practical approach to the diagnosis and management of IA in elite tennis players. # Level of Evidence 5 Conclusion IA is a common but often overlooked condition in overhead athletes, especially elite tennis players. This clinical commentary emphasizes the importance of regular preventative screenings to detect IA early and initiate an appropriate exercise program, which includes the reduction of potential risk factors. Implementing these strategies can significantly reduce the incidence and impact of IA, helping athletes remain healthy and competitive while enhancing their overall musculoskeletal health and performance. Even if a tennis player does not exhibit functional deficits, it remains crucial to frequently assess for IA to prevent injuries elsewhere in the body or to identify the source of nearby injuries. Coaches, physical therapists, and athletes across all overhead sports should focus on specifically strengthening the external rotators in overhead positions and address shoulder imbalances.

PMC12524677,Improving Methodological Quality in Meta-Analyses of Athlete Pain Interventions: An Overview of Systematic Reviews.,2025,"Background: Pain is a disabling issue in athletes, with significant impact on performance and career longevity. Many randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have explored interventions to reduce pain, leading to multiple systematic reviews with meta-analysis, but their methodological rigor and clinical applicability remain unclear. Objective: To provide an overview of systematic reviews with meta-analysis on interventions aimed at alleviating pain intensity in athletes, identifying knowledge gaps and appraising methodological quality. Methods: CINAHL, Embase, Epistemonikos, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to February 2025. Systematic reviews with meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating interventions to manage pain in athletes were considered. Athletes without restrictions in terms of sports, clinical, and sociodemographic characteristics were included. Overlap between reviews was calculated using the corrected covered area. Results: Twelve systematic reviews met inclusion criteria. Physical exercise modalities (e.g., gait retraining, hip strengthening), acupuncture, photo biomodulation, and topical medication showed potential benefits in reducing pain intensity. Other interventions, such as certain manual therapy techniques, platelet-rich plasma, or motor imagery, did not show consistent effects. All reviews focused solely on pain intensity, with minimal stratification by sport or clinical condition which may affect the extrapolation of meta-analyzed findings to the clinical practice. Methodological quality was often low, with flaws in reporting funding sources, lists of excluded studies, and certainty of evidence (was mostly rated as low/very low). Overlap was variable across the interventions. Conclusions: Given low/sparse certainty and minimal sport-specific analyses, no strong clinical recommendations can be made; preliminary signals favor proximal hip strengthening, gait retraining, photo biomodulation (acute soreness), and topical NSAIDs pending higher-quality syntheses. Future reviews should consider mandatory GRADE; pre-registered protocols; sport- and condition-specific analyses; and core outcome sets including multi-dimensional pain. 5. Conclusions While some interventions may alleviate pain intensity in athletes across various sports and with different clinical conditions, the current state of most meta-analyses (mainly low/very low evidence when GRADE was used) prevents the formulation of strong recommendations that can be adopted in clinical practice. Mandatory protocol registration, GRADE assessment, and analyses stratified by sport/condition should be a priority in future reviews. Coaches, athletic trainers, and policymakers should know that there are other pain dimensions that have not been explored in previous reviews rather than pain intensity, and no robust meta-analyzed data are available for most of the sports (e.g., swimming, cricket, basketball, or hockey).",0.6257501230922475,0.6257501230922475,0.15396184853760983,0.15396184853760983,0.446650153877846,0.446650153877846,0.4621526635183047,0.4621526635183047,0.49817689680119526,0.4527726725763013,0.5032115204593868,0.38902789549328026,0.47466561421786013,4

PMC12035091,Nonoperative Management of Ulnar Collateral Ligament Injuries in the Throwing Athlete: A Framework for Return to Throwing.,2025,"Background: Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries in throwing athletes result from repetitive valgus stress to the elbow in a flexed position. Muscular dysfunction of the forearm and shoulder musculature is commonly associated with UCL injuries. Nonoperative rehabilitation should generally start with a rest period, followed by progressive strengthening of the upper extremity, and eventually, a systematic throwing program. Indications: Nonoperative management is first line for UCL injuries. Trained rehabilitation professionals, including physical therapists or athletic trainers, should be involved early and guide the progression of exercise throughout the recovery process. Technique Description: In the first 1 to 2 weeks, the goals include strengthening rotator cuff, scapulothoracic, and forearm musculature while protecting the damaged UCL by avoiding valgus stress. Weeks 3 to 4 progress strengthening to more demanding movements, utilizing larger muscle groups while introducing shoulder internal rotation strengthening. The goals of weeks 5 to 6 are to increase the speed of movement as the athlete prepares to return to more throwing-like activity. The athlete can begin a progressive, monitored throwing program as early as 7 weeks. Results: The purpose of this video is to provide a suggested framework for the progression of rehabilitative exercises in athletes with UCL injuries. Discussion/Conclusion: A well-designed return to throwing program respects tissue load tolerance. It is important that the athlete remain pain-free throughout the rehabilitation process.

PMC12195825,Predicting Injury in Collegiate Baseball and Softball Athletes Using Functional Testing: A Pilot Study.,2025,"Non-contact injuries are common in collegiate throwing athletes. Identifying musculoskeletal issues that predispose athletes to injuries would be valuable for reducing the associated risk. The purpose of this pilot study was to use binomial logistic regression to identify injury-prone athletes with multiple pre-season functional measures and demographic information. Eighteen Division II baseball and softball athletes underwent pre-season functional testing including measures of manual muscle testing of the dominant shoulder muscles (MMT), the functional movement screen (FMS), and closed kinetic chain upper extremity stability (CKCUES). A certified athletic trainer at the university diagnosed and documented the injuries that these athletes sustained over the course of the season. Binomial logistic regression models were used to assess the effects of FMS composite score, CKCUES normative score, MMT scores, and demographic information on the likelihood that participants would sustain (a) any type of injury and (b) a shoulder injury during the competitive season. The model for injury was not significant ( p = 0.822), correctly classifying 72.2% of cases. The model for shoulder injury was significant ( p = 0.039) and correctly classified 100% of cases. These results suggest that shoulder injury incidence may potentially be predicted using sport-specific movement tests in baseball and softball athletes. A larger sample size is needed to verify these results in the future. 5. Conclusions Numerous factors have been identified as risk factors for injury. This study attempted to identify if multiple factors could be utilized together to identify upper extremity athletes at risk for injury. Utilizing FMS composite score, CKCUES normative score, MMT data for dominant shoulders, and demographic information including height, weight, and sex, we were able to accurately identify those that would experience an injury as well as a those who would experience a shoulder injury. This research suggests that injury-prone baseball and softball athletes have the potential to be predicted through pre-season screenings and utilizing logistic regression, as demonstrated in this study.",0.5257574443102816,0.5257574443102816,0.013518459185239608,0.013518459185239608,0.37000314739560397,0.37000314739560397,0.3840052668891617,0.3840052668891617,0.5491131834103465,0.6060227089999567,0.43473750210950113,0.47770480115701525,0.44547932687137964,4

PMC12467621,Current Concepts in Pathogenesis and Conservative Management of Supraspinous Tendinopathies Using Shockwave Therapy-A Narrative Review of the Literature.,2025,"The supraspinatus has been well studied in recent years, since the rotator cuff muscle is most commonly damaged, affecting the quality of life for patients with tendinopathy. Despite this tiny but crucial muscle being well-described, there is still much left to learn and discover, especially because chronic supraspinatus tendinopathy is a common pain syndrome that causes functional and labor disabilities in the population. The present narrative review, including systematic elements from biomechanical and clinical studies, highlights the role of conservative treatment using shockwave therapy. Objectives : We set out to perform a complex analysis of the literature on this topic to identify possible pathophysiological mechanisms that can be used to establish proper therapeutic management, focused specifically on conservative treatment using shockwave therapy. Methods : We researched the medical literature, including clinical studies that met the criteria of being published after 2014. In this review, we described the mechanisms and histological changes in tendinopathy to illustrate the biological effects of shockwave therapy and performed a literature review on its therapeutic effects. Conclusions : The multifaced pathophysiology of supraspinous tendinopathies compromised the healing responses. Recent findings highlight the value of a thorough diagnostic and treatment strategy, with shockwave therapy (ESWT) as a conservative treatment option. According to available data, shockwave therapy has demonstrated significant improvement in function, improving participants’ discomfort, quality of life, and pain relief. It can also be combined with isometric exercise. Given the substantial risk of bias and heterogeneity, our findings should be interpreted cautiously. The need for more research to optimize parameters and provide standardized clinical guidelines is highlighted by the variety of treatment procedures. Improving outcomes in patients with supraspinous tendinopathies will require a better comprehension of the pathology, and individualized treatment needs to be further investigated. 7. Conclusions Examining papers from the past 10 years, this review looks at how the supraspinous muscle changes in rotator cuff disease and also intends to point out how conservative rehabilitation treatment, including new procedures such as extracorporeal shockwave therapy, becomes a common substitute for conventional surgical methods, yielding good results and increasing the patient’s quality of life [ 118 ].

PMC11695664,Different patterns of neurogenic quadrilateral space syndrome: a case series of undefined posterior shoulder pain.,2025,"Background Quadrilateral space syndrome is a painful disorder of the shoulder caused by static or dynamic entrapment of the axillary nerve and the posterior humeral circumflex artery. It was first described in 1983; however, it is an uncommon syndrome that initially presents with nonspecific shoulder pain or selective deltoid atrophy, and diagnosis is often delayed owing to its rarity. Young athletes of overhead sports are more commonly affected by this syndrome. Symptoms of quadrilateral space syndrome include silent deltoid atrophy, persistent posterior shoulder pain, paresthesias, and tenderness over the quadrilateral space. Vascular symptoms may involve thrombosis and embolisms of the upper limb. Instrumental tests and imaging are not always conclusive, leading to frequent misdiagnosis of the syndrome. Patients and methods The aim of this study is to present a case series of four patients diagnosed with neurogenic quadrilateral space syndrome, describe different clinical presentations, and suggest tips for diagnosing this syndrome. All patients underwent a detailed medical history collection, were interviewed about the sports and hobbies they engaged in, and received a comprehensive clinical examination of the neck and shoulder. Patients also underwent diagnostic exams such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electromyography. An ultrasound-guided injection of local anesthetic was performed into the quadrilateral space. Results All patients affected by neurogenic quadrilateral space syndrome underwent conservative treatment, which included a rehabilitation program. Only one out of four patients experienced complete resolution of symptoms and did not require surgical decompression. Conclusions To properly treat this rare syndrome, we propose classifying it as either “dynamic” or “static,” on the basis of the clinical history, MRI findings, and physical examination. The study includes a rehabilitation program that was effective for one patient, demonstrating that surgical decompression may be avoidable if the cases are promptly diagnosed and classified.

PMC12214370,Minimum 10-Year Outcomes of Arthroscopic Capsulolabral Repair for Posterior Shoulder Instability,2025,"Background: Posterior shoulder instability (PSI) is a multifactorial condition of atraumatic or traumatic onset that most frequently affects young male athletes. To address capsulolabral detachment, arthroscopic posterior capsulolabral repair with suture anchors can be performed. Purpose: To report patient-reported outcomes (PROs), failure rates, survivorship, and return-to-sport/activity rates after arthroscopic posterior capsulolabral repair with suture anchors at a minimum of 10 years after surgery. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients who underwent arthroscopic posterior capsulolabral repair for PSI by a single surgeon between November 2005 and September 2010 were included; patients with multidirectional instability and concomitant bony reconstruction were excluded. Demographic, surgical, and subjective data were collected prospectively and retrospectively reviewed. PROs that were collected included the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES); Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE); Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH); and 12-Item Short Form physical component summary (SF-12 PCS) scores. Recurrent instability, dislocations, and reoperations were recorded, and a survivorship analysis was performed. Results: Overall, 17 shoulders in 16 patients (all male; mean age, 31.4 years; age range, 19.2-51.2 years) were included. The onset of PSI was atraumatic in 11 shoulders (65%) and traumatic in 6 shoulders (35%). Three patient shoulders (17.6%) underwent revision surgery for instability or osteoarthritis at 6.3, 7.6, and 12.5 years postoperatively. A minimum 10-year follow-up was obtained in 12 of 14 remaining shoulders (86%), with a mean follow-up of 13.1 years. For patients not requiring revision surgery, pre- to postoperatively, the ASES score significantly improved (72.6 to 89.9; P = .016), as did the SF-12 PCS score (43.8 to 55.0; P = .002). The mean postoperative SANE score was 86.9, and the mean postoperative QuickDASH score was 6.6. Median satisfaction was 8 (range, 3-10). At follow-up, 67% of patients had returned to their original fitness program. Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis showed an 86.7% survival rate at 10 years. Conclusion: Study findings indicated that arthroscopic posterior capsulolabral repair was an effective treatment for patients with PSI, albeit with a 17.6% revision rate. Patients who did not require revision had satisfactory PRO scores that were maintained at long-term follow-up.

PMC12025889,Dental Splints and Sport Performance: A Review of the Current Literature.,2025,"Background/Objectives : Lately, there has been a greater focus on the function of the dento-mandibular apparatus, specifically on the location of the jaw and occlusion. Given the new potential insights, the current study aimed to comprehensively analyze the published literature on the use of occlusal splints and their effects on exercise performance. Methods : A search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for papers published between 2014 and 2024. Starting from the 128 identified records, 28 were finally included for review. Results : The extensive literature review revealed significant diversity in the experimental conditions, suggesting that the occlusal splints may enhance exercise performance and support dental health. Conclusions : The present study highlights the growing interest in occlusal splints research and its impact on sport and exercise science. Mouthguards or occlusal splints should continue to be worn in sports with a considerable risk of orofacial injury. Regardless of how they affect performance, mouthguards or occlusal splints are crucial for athletes in many sports to prevent oral and dental injuries. 5. Conclusions This study underscores the critical role of occlusal splints in maintaining and improving oral health by addressing issues such as bite misalignment, bruxism, and TMD. Occlusal splints also act as a preventive measure against dental wear and potential long-term complications. Regular dental check-ups and assessments are essential to determine the appropriateness and effectiveness of occlusal splints for individual patients, ensuring personalized treatment plans that optimize their therapeutic benefits. In contrast, mouthguards are primarily designed to protect athletes’ teeth and oral structures from impact-related injuries. Their mandatory implementation in high-risk sports remains crucial to injury prevention strategies. While distinct in their primary function—occlusal splints focusing on therapeutic intervention and mouthguards on injury prevention—both devices contribute to overall oral stability and influence jaw positioning. The findings from this study emphasize the need for standardized research methodologies to assess the full impact of occlusal splints on oral health, neuromuscular function, and sports performance. Future investigations should optimize design features, improve material properties, and refine clinical recommendations to enhance their effectiveness for therapeutic and protective purposes.",0.503292245839418,0.503292245839418,0.29812776165336574,0.29812776165336574,0.12022970858688181,0.12022970858688181,0.2398034118643505,0.2398034118643505,0.2667493180836423,0.13235818019835546,0.31681656402310554,0.24880137062991328,0.29981276567480747,4
PMC12011942,Dry Needling in Sports and Sport Recovery: A Systematic Review with an Evidence Gap Map.,2025,"Background Dry needling is an increasingly popular technique used in sports and regenerative medicine contexts. However, there is no comprehensive overview of investigations of dry needling in sports and sport recovery. Objectives The objectives were to perform a systematic review of dry needling in sports athletes with an evidence gap map, to identify current gaps in the literature, and to provide stakeholders with direction for future research. Methods Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines were followed. Studies on healthy and injured athletes receiving dry needling were included. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched, data were synthesized narratively, key data were summarized quantitatively, and an evidence gap map was created. Results The authors incorporated 24 studies into the current study, encompassing 580 athletes, predominantly involving talent/developmental and highly trained/national-level athletes across 13 sports. Most studies used passive or placebo controls, with 37.5% incorporating active controls. Interventions focused mainly on the lower limbs (58.3%). Around 69% of studies reported pain perception outcomes, while six examined muscular strength, activity, and range of motion. While results varied, dry needling generally showed a more positive effect on pain than on athletic performance. Conclusions Dry needling studies seem to describe general effectiveness and safety for reducing pain and muscle stiffness in a wide variety of body regions. However, further research is needed on underrepresented populations such as elite, world-class, and Paralympic athletes, as well as expanding investigations into long-term effects and a broader range of muscle groups, particularly the hamstrings.

PMC12154440,Selective Activation of the Subscapularis Muscle: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study.,2025,"Background/Objectives: Clinicians have employed various therapeutic exercises to enhance the function and strength of the subscapularis muscle (SSC). However, few studies have investigated the most effective exercise for selectively activating the SSC while minimizing compensation from surrounding shoulder musculatures. Methods: Forty healthy participants without any shoulder complex conditions participated in this study. Individuals with a history of shoulder pain or musculoskeletal or neurological conditions affecting shoulder internal rotation were excluded. Participants performed three exercises: (1) Belly Press, (2) Lift Off, and (3) Prone Wiper, in a randomized order generated using Microsoft Excel. Ultrasound was then performed to assess the SSC and infraspinatus (IS) muscle thickness. Surface electromyography was used to record anterior deltoid (AD), pectoralis major (PM), and posterior deltoid (PD) muscle activity. Radiographic imaging was employed to evaluate the path of the instantaneous center of rotation (PICR). Data were analyzed using a one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni adjustment. Results: A significant reduction in IS thickness and PICR was observed only following the Belly Press ( p < 0.05). Electromyographic activity of AD, PM, and PD increased significantly across all exercises ( p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that the Belly Press most effectively allows the SSC to generate force while maintaining a stable center of rotation during shoulder movement. Conclusions: The Belly Press was most effective in selectively activating the SSC while minimizing surrounding shoulder rotator muscle activity and reducing PICR. This finding may help clinicians identify and treat patients with shoulder internal rotation injuries. 5. Conclusions The Belly Press uniquely resulted in a significant increase in SSC thickness, a concurrent decrease in IS thickness, and a reduction in the PICR. Our results suggest that the Belly Press is the most effective of the three exercises in selectively activating the SSC while enhancing joint stability through minimized PICR distance. These findings may assist clinicians in designing more effective exercise programs. And, as noted above as a limitation, the findings of this study are preliminary and should be validated through future research employing more rigorous and robust designs to confirm their clinical efficacy.",0.5292008126747159,0.5292008126747159,0.30913298160934016,0.30913298160934016,0.4376774889741289,0.4376774889741289,0.44131999626821566,0.44131999626821566,0.5099607027277963,0.47924387808909064,0.4864528917719598,0.4381894915310026,0.4743870417117205,4
PMC12072096,Vestibular Well-Being Benefits of a Single Session of Functional Neurology Intervention on Saccadic Stimuli Dysfunction.,2025,"Background/Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the psychophysiological effects of functional neurology intervention on dysfunction in vestibular saccadic stimuli, focusing on its impact on muscle performance, psychophysiological arousal, and pain perception. Methods: Seventy-five healthy volunteer participants were randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group that received functional neurology treatment and a control group that did not. Both groups underwent the same evaluations at four distinct time points. Key measurements included pressure pain threshold (PPT), hand strength, critical flicker fusion threshold (CFFT), blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, and the number of saccadic stimuli tolerated until dysfunction in an indicator muscle (anterior deltoid). The functional neurology intervention involved proprioceptive reflexes, trigger point desensitization, and systemic approaches to rectify neuromuscular dysfunctions. Results: The results showed that the functional neurology intervention significantly increased the number of saccadic stimuli tolerated, from 3.6 ± 3.3 to 26.1 ± 8.7, indicating an improvement in neuromuscular endurance. Additionally, PPT readings exhibited an upward trend from baseline to post-intervention, with the final reading averaging at 10.2 ± 5.3 kgf, and hand strength measurements showed a modest but significant increase post-intervention. Notably, CFFT and blood oxygen saturation levels remained relatively stable, suggesting that the intervention’s primary impact was on neuromuscular performance and pain perception rather than on cognitive arousal or systemic oxygenation. Heart rate data indicated a decrease post-intervention, implying potential improvements in autonomic nervous system function. In contrast, the control group did not present significant changes in any of the psychophysiological parameters evaluated. These findings underscore the potential of targeted functional neurology treatments to enhance physical performance and provide valuable therapeutic benefits for neuromuscular and cognitive dysfunctions. Conclusions: Functional neurology interventions can effectively improve muscle endurance, pain management, and overall neuromuscular health, highlighting its relevance as a therapeutic modality in sports performance optimization and rehabilitation contexts. 5. Conclusions This study provides compelling evidence that a single session of functional neurology intervention can significantly enhance neuromuscular endurance, improve pain thresholds, and modulate physiological responses associated with visual–motor integration in healthy participants. The findings suggest that targeted neuroplasticity-driven treatments may play a critical role in optimizing both performance and rehabilitation strategies. However, while these results highlight a promising therapeutic potential, the study’s exploratory nature and limited sample size necessitate further investigation to establish causality and generalizability. Future research should employ longitudinal designs and neurophysiological assessments to validate these effects and better understand the underlying neural mechanisms. These insights could contribute to refining neuromodulatory approaches in clinical and sports performance contexts, reinforcing the importance of integrating visual–motor interventions into broader neuromuscular rehabilitation frameworks.",0.5008066217253624,0.5008066217253624,0.4172769230206682,0.4172769230206682,0.24435507727268124,0.24435507727268124,0.056181678864147704,0.056181678864147704,0.40439450000356675,0.34671287246839344,0.37066749237512675,0.3197196005879048,0.35793051942832127,4
PMC12344098,Rehabilitation Interventions for Fear-Avoidance Beliefs and Behaviors in Sudden Onset Musculoskeletal Conditions: A Scoping Review.,2025,"Abstract Fear avoidance (FA) describes beliefs and behaviors related to avoiding movements or activities after a painful event. Fear avoidance is a prevalent issue that limits the recovery outcomes and social reintegration of burn survivors. However, as current literature focuses on chronic conditions, understanding the impact and treatment of FA within sudden onset musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions, specifically in the burn survivor population, is lacking. The purpose of this scoping review is to synthesize evidence-based rehabilitation interventions aimed at improving FA behaviors and beliefs after sudden onset MSK conditions and to provide suggestions for clinical application with the burn survivor population. Ovid Medline, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were sourced from inception to May 2023. Monthly Google Scholar searches and hand-searching of included articles’ reference lists were done to add additional relevant publications. Eligibility criteria included: (1) adults with sudden onset MSK condition, (2) intervention from a rehabilitation professional, and (3) FA as the primary outcome. Four authors performed data extraction using the TIDIER checklist. Seven intervention types were identified: (1) education; (2) exercise; (3) graded motor imagery; (4) manual therapy (MT); (5) multimodal—education with exercise; (6) multimodal—education with MT and exercise; and (7) multimodal—interactive gaming console with exercise. All intervention types, except MT, demonstrated significant decreases in FA. This review summarizes effective rehabilitation interventions to address FA while highlighting the role of rehabilitation professionals in improving function and alleviating potential disability stemming from FA despite physical recovery. CONCLUSION This scoping review summarized and synthesized the current literature exploring rehabilitation treatment interventions to address FA for sudden onset MSK conditions, such as the burn survivor population. This review supports investigating the impact of incorporating the following interventions into clinical practice with burn survivors, including systematic documentation of FA outcomes: The use of multimedia-based education to comprehensively disseminate relevant information regarding the neuroscience of pain, which is customized to the patients’ situation, condition, and treatment. The implementation and continuous use of active coping skills, identification of personal barriers to rehabilitation, and promotion of self-efficacy throughout the rehabilitation program. The use of grading for activities, exercises, or tasks to allow the patient to progress with minimal pain in order to promote their participation and re-engagement in valued activities. The use of GMI, specifically phase 2 (visualization).

PMC11998972,Common sports-related nerve injuries seen by the electrodiagnostic medical consultant.,2025,"Abstract The high physiologic demands of sports create dynamic stress on joints, soft tissues, and nerves which may lead to injuries in the athlete. Electrodiagnostic (EDx) assessment is essential to identify the correct diagnosis, localization, and prognosis, to guide management of sports‐related neuropathies. A comprehensive review was performed to provide the EDx medical consultant with a practical approach to the common peripheral nerve disorders seen in athletes. Sports‐related neuropathies reviewed include transient traumatic irritation of the brachial plexus and/or cervical nerve roots (“Burners and stingers,”) suprascapular and axillary neuropathies, ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) in throwers, ulnar neuropathy at the hand/wrist in cyclists, multi‐ligamentous knee injury, and foot/ankle neuropathies including tarsal tunnel syndrome. A thorough understanding of peripheral anatomy, possible entrapment sites, mechanisms of injury, and key physical examination findings is essential for correct diagnosis. EDx assessments beyond routine studies are generally required for sports‐related neuropathy, which may not necessarily follow typical entrapment patterns. Adjunct diagnostic imaging, such as point‐of‐care ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, are helpful tools to identify associated musculoskeletal pathology such as compressive cysts or nerve entrapment, which may be amenable to interventional or surgical treatment. When no clear reversible structural pathology exists, management of sports‐related neuropathy is athlete‐specific and generally multi‐modal, involving a combination of physical rehabilitation techniques to address muscle imbalances, load management, protective equipment, and interventional pain procedures. 8 CONCLUSION Management of sports‐related neuropathies requires a detailed knowledge of peripheral nerve anatomy. The EMC should consider the unique biomechanical factors involved in an athlete's sport, which may predispose them to nerve traction or compression. Neuromuscular ultrasound is a valuable tool that is often complementary to EDx tests. Treatment of sports‐related neuropathy should be athlete‐centered and may include a combination of activity modification, focused strengthening, physical modalities, bracing, and image‐guided interventions.",0.3987415026546447,0.3987415026546447,0.19632450973441518,0.19632450973441518,0.6741675309968589,0.6741675309968589,0.565478159191161,0.565478159191161,0.7257132421785117,0.6655759551543465,0.5513258134044946,0.49962554225394307,0.5384007456168567,4

Methods This single-center, single-blind, parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial was designed to compare two interventions in athletes clinically diagnosed with SIS and SD. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. Sample size was determined a priori using G*Power (f = 0.25, α = 0.05, power = 0.80), yielding a required sample of 28; 32 participants were planned to account for potential dropout. Inclusion criteria were: male overhead athletes aged 18–25 years with clinically diagnosed SIS and SD. Exclusion criteria included prior surgery or other contraindications. Participants were randomized to either SDBET or MPT groups. Both groups received 8 weeks of intervention (3 sessions/week) and a 4-week follow-up. The primary variable was disability, measured using the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). The secondary variables were pain (measured using the Visual Analog Scale [VAS]), shoulder active range of motion (AROM, measured using goniometry), strength (measured using Isometric Strength Tests [IST] of scapular stabilizers and external rotators), and scapular kinematics (measured using the Scapular Dyskinesis Test [SDT]). Assessments were conducted at baseline, week 8, and week 12. Result A total of 32 participants were analyzed (SDBET group: n = 16; MPT group: n = 16). Mixed-design ANOVA revealed significant main effects of time for all outcomes (all p < 0.001, η² = 0.71–0.92), and significant group effects for SPADI and IST ( p < 0.01). Significant Time × Group interactions were also observed for all variables ( p < 0.05, η² = 0.15–0.76), prompting further simple effects analysis. Disability (SPADI) decreased significantly in both groups by week 8 ( p < 0.001, η² = 0.03), with no between-group difference. However, only the SDBET group maintained improvements at week 12 ( p < 0.001, η² = 0.59). Pain (VAS) decreased more in the MPT group at week 8 ( p = 0.018, η² = 0.17), but rebounded by week 12, eliminating group differences ( p = 0.268, η² = 0.04). Active range of motion (AROM) improved in both groups by week 8 ( p < 0.001), with only the SDBET group sustaining these gains at week 12 ( p < 0.001, η² = 0.37). Strength (IST of scapular stabilizers and external rotators) improved exclusively in the SDBET group at both week 8 and 12 (all p < 0.001), with significant between-group differences (η² = 0.57–0.74). Scapular kinematics (SDT) improved in 43.8% of SDBET participants, while no change was observed in the MPT group ( p = 0.001–0.004). Conclusion Both SDBET and MPT improved shoulder disability, pain and AROM in SIS patients with SD, but only SDBET showed lasting effects. Targeted therapy has more comprehensive and sustained effects.

PMC11956748,Effects of Blood Flow Restriction Training on the Upper Extremities: A Scoping Review.,2025,"High-intensity training leads to muscle growth in the upper extremities but at the expense of a greater risk of damaging joints, ligaments, or tendons due to this region being more prone to injury. In contrast, low-intensity resistance training implements a low load with high repetition, which is safer but yields less muscle hypertrophy and greater time consumption. Blood flow restriction (BFR) training potentially provides a solution as it achieves the muscle growth and strengthening of high-intensity resistance training while safely performing low-intensity resistance training. This technique reduces venous return and arterial blood flow to the targeted limb, creating a physiological environment to induce muscle hypertrophy, increase strength, and prolong endurance while minimizing tissue stress. This study will analyze literature within the past 10 years on the usage of BFR training in the upper extremities. An extensive search on PubMed was performed using the term “blood flow restriction training upper extremity,” which resulted in 98 articles that were narrowed down to 17 based on clinical trials and relevance to upper extremities. Results from this study demonstrate that BFR training enhances muscle hypertrophy and strength in the upper extremity muscles, including the biceps brachii and triceps brachii at low loads. Additionally, BFR training has been shown to promote adaptations in non-occluded muscles proximal and contralateral to the cuff location. Clinical applications include postoperative recovery, rehabilitation of rotator cuff injuries, and treatment of tendinopathies. BFR training offers an effective alternative to high-load resistance training for the upper extremities with promising applications in rehabilitation and injury prevention. Future research is necessary to address long-term effects, optimize protocols, and diversify its applications. Conclusions In conclusion, BFR training has shown many substantial benefits in enhancing muscle strength, size, and endurance in the upper extremities across a variety of populations. This technique is valuable for athletes wanting to improve their performance. Low-load BFR has demonstrated similar effects to high-load exercises while minimizing cardiovascular and hemodynamic stress and mechanical strain on the tissues and joints. BFR has a decreased risk of muscle damage, which can be especially useful for older populations who cannot perform high-load activities or those who are recovering from a sensitive injury. Future research is still necessary, specifically on the effects of BFR on upper extremity injuries as well as a standardized protocol such as continuous versus intermittent BFR, high vs low-pressure BFR, and types of exercises. Overall, BFR is an innovative approach to exercising that may be beneficial for a variety of populations, making it a versatile tool in clinical and athletic settings.",0.6677664486969258,0.6677664486969258,0.43707025558036877,0.43707025558036877,0.3884919965865048,0.3884919965865048,0.49478003755066463,0.49478003755066463,0.3390862412788623,0.3895132192825469,0.5159171357555282,0.2926555462134102,0.46010173836999874,4
PMC11901267,"The Human Disharmony Loop: A Case Series Proposing the Unique Role of the Pectoralis Minor in a Unifying Syndrome of Chronic Pain, Neuropathy, and Weakness.",2025,"Background/Objectives : Many patients evaluated by shoulder specialists suffer from intractable pain, neuropathy, and weakness. The pectoralis minor (PM) remains the only scapula muscle to receive lower trunk (C8-T1) input. We propose a novel syndrome: the Human Disharmony Loop. This model portrays how this unique PM innervation causes scapular dyskinesia, which deranges the anatomy of the upper limb girdle and produces a refractory symptom complex of pain, neuropathy, and weakness. We hypothesize that certain patients with historically intractable symptoms of the upper limb girdle may benefit from PM tenotomy. Methods : Ten patients of diverse etiologies presented with a similar constellation of complaints. The patients included a female athlete, a female with macromastia, a male bodybuilder, and patients with post-radiation breast cancer, post-operative shoulder arthroplasty, interscalene block injury, cervical spine disease, persistent impingement after rotator cuff repair, direct traction injury, and occupational disorder. All patients exhibited coracoid tenderness, scapula protraction with internal rotation and anterior tilt, and pain involving the neck, shoulder, and upper back. The patients demonstrated varying degrees of arm neuropathy, subacromial impingement, and occipital headaches. The patients failed all prior treatments by multiple subspecialists, including surgery. Each patient underwent isolated open PM tenotomy. Results : In all ten patients, PM tenotomy substantially reduced shoulder, upper back, and neck pain, cleared concomitant neuropathy, restored full motion, and eradicated occipital headaches. The response to surgery was rapid, dramatic, and durable. Conclusions : The unique asymmetric neurologic innervation to the sole ventral stabilizer of the scapula, the pectoralis minor, predisposes the human shoulder to neurologic and musculoskeletal imbalance. This produces the Human Disharmony Loop: a clinical syndrome spanning from the neck to the fingertips, with chronic pain, neuropathy, and weakness. These challenging patients may benefit dramatically from isolated PM tenotomy. 5.

Total ankle replacement (TAR) represents a significant advancement in orthopedic surgery. Objectives : The purpose was to provide an overview of the indications, outcomes, and complications of anterior and lateral surgical approaches in TAR, as well as return to sport following surgery. Methods : The PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Central databases were searched. The keywords used were “total ankle arthroplasty”, “total ankle replacement”, “ankle anterior approach”, “ankle lateral approach”, “outcomes”, “return to sport”, and “complications”, and the search included articles published from 2014 to 2024. Results : Successful functional outcomes, return to athletic activity, and return to the previous level of sports performance after surgery have been reported at rates of over 60%. The anterior approach restores the normal tibial slope but presents a high risk of wound-healing complications and medial malleolar fractures. The lateral approach allows an anatomic placement of the implant, but it is associated with fibular complications and a high risk of revision surgery. Return to sport is feasible in low-impact sports such as cycling, swimming, and dancing. Conclusions: The anterior and lateral approaches for TAR yielded satisfactory functional outcomes and rates of return to athletic activity. Different intra- and post-operative complications and revision surgery should be managed properly to optimize outcomes. 10.

PMC11223446,Utilizing Diagnostic Musculoskeletal Ultrasound for Assessment of the Infraspinatus Muscle and Tendon: Implications for Rehabilitation Professionals.,2024,"The rotator cuff, comprising the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor muscles, plays a crucial role in stabilizing the glenohumeral joint by securing the head of the humerus within the glenoid cavity of the scapula. The tendinous insertions of these muscles generate tension within the capsule, enhancing joint stability during muscular activity. The rotator cuff is susceptible to damage from disease, injury, or trauma, which can result in tears or ruptures of one or more tendons. The evaluation of the infraspinatus muscle and tendon is vital for diagnosing and managing various shoulder pathologies. Accurate imaging to determine the specific muscle involvement and injury severity significantly impacts treatment decisions. Diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK-US) has emerged as a valuable tool for assessing the infraspinatus muscle and tendon, offering real-time, dynamic assessment capabilities essential for precise diagnosis and effective rehabilitation planning. This article reviews the utility and advantages of MSK-US in evaluating the infraspinatus muscle and tendon, emphasizing technique specifics, diagnostic accuracy, and comparative efficacy against other imaging modalities. It details a systematic approach to the ultrasound examination technique for the infraspinatus, including patient positioning and identification of common pathologies such as tears, tendinopathy, and calcifications. With recent advancements in transducer strength, image resolution, and operator training, ultrasound serves as an excellent alternative imaging modality for diagnosing rotator cuff tears. This article aims to equip rehabilitation professionals with a comprehensive understanding of MSK-US as a diagnostic tool for the infraspinatus, promoting more precise diagnosis, treatment planning and improved patient outcomes. Conclusion Musculoskeletal ultrasound has emerged as a pivotal tool for assessing and managing disorders of the infraspinatus muscle and tendon. Its capability to deliver real-time, high-resolution imaging renders it invaluable for dynamic evaluations and guiding rehabilitation protocols. Despite inherent limitations, the benefits of MSK-US position it as a cornerstone of contemporary clinical practice. To effectively integrate MSK-US into rehabilitation settings, practitioners must acquire specialized training encompassing both ultrasound techniques and detailed knowledge of infraspinatus musculoskeletal anatomy. By leveraging this technology in clinical practice, rehabilitation providers can elevate diagnostic accuracy, optimize therapeutic interventions, and ultimately enhance outcomes for patients grappling with shoulder pathologies. 233498 Infraspinatus Tendon Figure 1A: Patient Position The patient is seated with the ipsilateral hand resting on the contralateral shoulder. This places the arm in a slight internal rotation and adduction pulling the infraspinatus in an anterior-lateral tensioned position. This provides the ability to see abnormalities in the tendon. Figure 1B: Short Axis Transducer Placement Short Axis (SAX) view places the transducer perpendicular to the floor, parallel to the axial spine and is perpendicular to the tendon fibers as they insert onto the humeral head. This view provides the ability to image the tendon footprint at its distal insertion. Figure 1C: Long Axis Transducer Placement Long Axis (LAX) view places the transducer parallel to the floor and perpendicular to the axial spine. This view places the transducer parallel with the fibers of the infraspinatus tendon. Start with the transducer placed in the middle of the deltoid and capturing the edge of the acromion. The acromion will be a bony landmark for orientation along with the humeral head. 233499 NORMAL VIEW IN SHORT AXIS (SAX) Figures 2A and 2B Short Axis View: Look for the bony cortex of the humeral head initially and the parallel fibers of the infraspinatus tendon as it inserts on the lateral facet of the greater tuberosity. The mild indention noted in the middle of the bony cortex represents the anatomical neck. The infraspinatus tendon lies on the humeral head and maintains a uniform appearance. Note that the tendon will exhibit a hyperechoic brightness. Identify the humeral head, the hyaline cartilage (seen as an anechoic interface above the cortex), the hyperechoic infraspinatus tendon, and its anechoic insertion onto the lateral facet of the greater tuberosity. This insertion typically has a larger anechoic footprint at its distal insertion, which should not be mistaken for pathology. Superior to the tendon is the anechoic space for the bursa, typically visible in non-pathological infraspinatus tendons. Above the tendon and bursa, you will see the deltoid muscle and the subcutaneous fat tissue at the top of the image. 233500 NORMAL VIEW IN LONG AXIS (LAX) Figures 3A and 3B Long Axis View: The Long Axis View technique will be parallel to the spine of the scapula placing the transducer parallel with the tendon fibers. This position should capture the edge of the acromion as shown in image 2A above. The acromion is the anechoic structure on the left and will be a bony landmark for orientation. Superior to the tendon would be the bursa and deltoid muscle followed by the subcutaneous fat tissue. The infraspinatus tendon should have a consistent hyperechoic nature but slightly less hyperechoic compared to the supraspinatus tendon. 233501 TENDINOSIS IN SHORT AXIS (SAX) AND LONG AXIS (LAX) VIEW: Figures 4A and 4B: Infraspinatus tendon in Short Axis view and Long Axis view shows increased thickness. This thickness is greater than 4.2 mm (outlined in yellow) and is known to indicate increased cellularity and is one of the criteria that is used to diagnosis tendinosis. Normal tendon thickness can vary slightly with age and with dominant verses non-dominant shoulders. For an individual 30-39 years old, normal thickness is 4.2 + 0.7 mm. Both images show abnormal hypoechogenicity (blue arrows) along with increased tendon thickness (yellow arrows). 233502 TENDINOUS FAILURE IN SHORT AXIS (SAX)VIEW Figure 5A: Disruption of the infraspinatus tendon which is shown above. Blue Arrow pointing to the hypoechoic changes within the tendon. 233503 TENDON CALCIFICATION IN SHORT AXIS (SAX) Figure 6A: Tendon Calcification and degenerative tendon. Ultrasound image shows a well-defined linear calcific deposit (blue arrows) along the infraspinatus tendon fibers with partial shadowing (yellow arrow).",0.7165977607982876,0.7165977607982876,0.31004094826170464,0.31004094826170464,0.6407880088784865,0.6407880088784865,0.45030690098713316,0.45030690098713316,0.8175839739700662,0.8120751169550324,0.6417728708180954,0.5764903238621999,0.6254522340791215,4
PMC12147367,Combined coracoclavicular ligament and transacromial capsule reconstruction for chronic acromioclavicular joint instability: clinical and radiological outcomes.,2025,"Objective: Acromioclavicular (AC) joint instability remains a challenging clinical problem, particularly in chronic cases where both vertical and horizontal stability must be restored. Traditional techniques have limitations in addressing multidirectional instability and minimizing implant-related complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of a combined coracoclavicular (CC) ligament and transacromial capsule reconstruction technique in patients with chronic AC joint instability. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 40 patients who underwent AC joint reconstruction at a single center from 2019 to 2023. Radiological outcomes (clavicle-coracoid distance) were evaluated preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at the last follow-up (6 months). Functional results were assessed using the Constant, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES), and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score. Data were analyzed using SPSS v28.0. T-tests and repeated measures of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were employed to compare outcomes, with significance set at P < .05. Results: The preoperative mean CC distance was 20.3 ± 3.4 mm. Early postoperative measurements showed a significant reduction in CC distance, with a mean of 9.5 ± 1.5 mm in the capsule reconstruction group compared to 10.5 ± 1.6 mm in the non-reconstruction group ( P = .053). At the 6-month follow-up, the late postoperative CC distance was maintained at 10.1 ± 1.6 mm in the reconstruction group, while it increased to 14.4 ± 2.0 mm in the non-reconstruction group ( P < .001). The mean ASES score was 87.1 ± 8.1. The mean Constant score was 86.2 ± 7.6. Pain levels, evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), decreased from a mean of 5.8 ± 1.2 preoperatively to 2.1 ± 1.0 postoperatively, indicating significant pain relief and improved functionality. No hardware failure or infection was noted. About 12.5% of patients experienced short-term anterior knee pain. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that combined CC ligament and transacromial capsule reconstruction improves radiographic outcomes by maintaining the clavicle-coracoid distance and enhances functional scores (ASES and Constant) in patients with chronic AC joint instability. Addressing both vertical and horizontal instability appears to contribute to better short-term clinical recovery. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings. Level of evidence: Level III (Retrospective Comparative Study). Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that combined CC ligament and transacromial capsule reconstruction improves radiographic outcomes by maintaining the clavicle-coracoid distance and enhances functional scores (ASES and Constant) in patients with chronic AC joint instability. Addressing both vertical and horizontal instability appears to contribute to better short-term clinical recovery.

PMC11263099,Integrative rehabilitation in the treatment of lumbosacral muscle strain in elite trampoline athletes: a pilot study.,2024,"Background Lumbosacral muscle strain (LMS) is common in Chinese elite trampoline athletes. Advanced lumbar muscle activation is necessary for postural control before upper extremity voluntary movements, called anticipatory postural adjustment to reduce internal postural interference (IPI). The potential of delayed lumbar muscle activation has been reported in patients with non-specific LBP (NLBP) in response to IPI. However, it remains unknown whether this effect exists in elite trampoline athletes. There is also limited literature reporting the rehabilitation of LMS in this population. This study first aimed to explore whether elite trampoline athletes with LMS experience delayed activation of lumbar muscles under IPI. The secondary aim was to preliminarily evaluate an integrative rehabilitation program's effectiveness. Materials and methods Ten elite trampoline athletes with LMS were recruited and received 10 sessions of integrative rehabilitation, including extracorporeal shock wave therapy, acupuncture, Tui-na, and spine function exercises. At baseline and after all sessions, the relative activation time of the lumbar muscles under IPI in a modified rapid arm-rise test was used as a primary outcome measure. The secondary measures included a visual analog scale (VAS) and a questionnaire to assess low back pain (LBP) and athletic training performance. Results The relative activation time of the lumbar muscles under IPI was delayed at baseline, but significantly decreased after the intervention ( P < 0.05). The VAS was significantly decreased after the intervention ( P < 0.05). There was no significant correlation between the difference in VAS and in activation time of the lumbar muscles before and after the intervention ( P > 0.05). Conclusions Elite trampoline athletes with LMS had delayed activation in their lumbar muscles under IPI. Integrative rehabilitation was effective in LBP relief and neuromuscular control of the lumbar muscles, and impacted positively on training performance. Future studies with a larger sample size, a control group, and long-term follow-ups are needed to further examine the efficacy of integrative rehabilitation in elite trampoline athletes with LMS. Additionally, the application of this approach in athletes with LMS or LBP in other sports, particularly those involving IPI, should be explored.

PMC11872060,Revealing the Progression of Pain Pathways and Identifying Chronification of Pain Predictors After an Isolated Lateral Ankle Sprain: Project RECOIL.,2025,"Abstract Persistent pain is a common complaint among civilians and military personnel after a lateral ankle sprain (LAS). Most individuals who experience pain after an LAS self-report a moderate pain intensity level that interferes with activity. This pain experience is mostly described through study designs and outcomes that limit the understanding of the acute to chronic pain transition after an LAS. The purpose of this prospective study is to quantify the prevalence rate of chronic ankle pain at 6-months post-injury and identify susceptibility and resiliency factors that contribute to pain chronification after an LAS. The objective of this study will be accomplished through a two-site prospective cohort study design with data collected at four timepoints (<7 days post-LAS, 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-LAS). A target sample size of 200 men or women (100 per site) between 18 and 45 years of age who sustain an acute LAS within the previous 7-days will be enrolled. Participants will complete a series of standardized electronic surveys at each timepoint to self-report the presence of chronic ankle pain, healthcare utilization patterns, subsequent musculoskeletal injury, and new co-morbid conditions. Additionally, participants will complete validated patient-reported outcomes (PROs) electronically to characterize the pain burden and undergo quantitative sensory testing to assess mechanical pain sensitivity via pressure pain thresholds, pain facilitation via temporal summation, and pain inhibition via a conditioned pain modulation response at all timepoints. Lastly, clinician-based outcomes will be completed at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-LAS to examine dynamic postural control, functional performance, and walking mechanics. We hypothesize that 30% of participants will self-report chronic ankle pain at 6-months post-injury. In addition, chronic pain at 6-months will be predicted by a combination of healthcare utilization patterns, prolonged levels of peripheral sensitization and pain facilitation, and worse functional performance and PROs.",0.24857883589465765,0.24857883589465765,0.26681842633135777,0.26681842633135777,0.3247843196562863,0.3247843196562863,0.4850853906589459,0.4850853906589459,0.5497339497953817,0.4530387636353313,0.3635771800186635,0.30990022486163415,0.35015794122940613,4
PMC11769462,Supervised vs. Self-Managed Exercise Therapy for Improving Shoulder Function After Traumatic Dislocation and Sprain: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2025,"Trauma-induced shoulder dislocations and sprains rank among the most common upper extremity injuries, with contact sports accounting for the majority of cases. These injuries often lead to substantial impairments in joint function and long recovery times, requiring targeted therapeutic interventions to restore mobility and prevent recurrent injuries. Given the pivotal role of exercise therapy in restoring shoulder function, this study systematically reviews the literature on the comparative effectiveness of supervised versus self-managed exercise therapy following acute shoulder trauma. PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, Web of Science, and Science Direct were searched up to 13 December 2024. Conservative and post-surgical treatment modes were analyzed separately. Five studies with a total 689 participants were included (conservative: n = 538 across two studies; post-surgical: n = 151 across three studies). Both treatment modes showed similar pooled effects (standardized mean difference, SMD conservative : − 0.35 , 95% CI [ − 1.39 , 0.69]; SMD post-surgical : − 0.23 , 95% CI [ − 1.21 , 0.75]), with a marginal improvement in shoulder function favoring supervised therapy. Four studies had some risk of bias, and one had serious risk; GRADE certainty was low. Supervised exercise therapy may offer slightly greater functional improvements over self-managed training, but evidence is limited by heterogeneity and low certainty. Further high-quality trials with standardized protocols and improved adherence tracking are needed to establish more definitive conclusions and guide clinical decision-making. 5. Conclusions This systematic review presents low-certainty evidence that patients with shoulder dislocations and sprains, whether treated conservatively or post-surgically, may experience slightly greater improvements in shoulder function with supervised therapy. Further rigorous research—including well-designed randomized controlled trials with standardized exercise across treatment groups, larger sample sizes, and adherence tracking—is needed to draw more definitive conclusions. Emerging technologies, particularly digital health tools, are gaining research interest due to their potential to enhance adherence and accessibility in self-managed settings. As studies incorporating these tools increase, the evidence base is expected to expand, leading to greater certainty in findings. This, in turn, could better inform clinical decision-making and optimize rehabilitation strategies compared to the current evidence base.",0.47793675355432,0.47793675355432,0.03592177670158369,0.03592177670158369,0.5355276199359822,0.5355276199359822,0.6349745401786289,0.6349745401786289,0.7023794138523485,0.6486420638679518,0.515456398617926,0.6205868921026868,0.5417390219891162,4
PMC11576559,A Pilot Study Comparing Intentional Shoulder Kinematics of Patients With Symptomatic Small-Size Supraspinatus Full-Thickness Tears With Healthy Controls.,2024,"Introduction: The prevailing view is that painful shoulders exhibit abnormal kinematics. This study explores the impact of symptomatic small-size supraspinatus tendon full-thickness tears on the three-dimensional (3D) kinematics of intentional, effortless shoulder movements. The hypothesis suggests that mechanical force buildup patterns, as indicated by motion jerk, will differ between healthy individuals and patients with symptomatic rotator cuff tendinopathy. Methods: A comparative analysis was conducted on two groups: 10 patients with painful shoulders due to a Grade 1 small-size full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon (Group A) and 10 healthy volunteers (Group B). Participants performed a standardized effortless shoulder movement task involving arm elevation and depression without external resistance, while an arm-attached accelerometer recorded movement data. The primary outcome was jerk (a derivative of acceleration), normalized to lean body mass (LBM), with comparisons made both within and between groups. Results: Vertical angular velocity was consistent across the study groups and in both arms of healthy volunteers, with mean values ranging from 70 to 86 degrees per second (deg/sec) (p = 0.79). No significant differences in jerk values were observed between groups or between dominant and non-dominant limbs in Group B (mean values: 0.001 to 0.004 m/sec³/kg LBM; p > 0.05). Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that small supraspinatus tendon full-thickness tears, when pain is the primary symptom, do not significantly affect the 3D kinematics of effortless shoulder movements. These findings challenge the notion that pain from rotator cuff tears leads to altered shoulder kinematics, with potential implications for clinical decision-making and assessing functional disability. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results. Conclusions The data presented should have an important indicative impact on evaluating the disability of patients with moderate rotator cuff tendinopathy with small supraspinatus tendon full-thickness tear. It might influence the decision-making regarding treating these patients, i.e., the indication for surgical vs. conservative treatment. The evaluation of the extent of physical disability might also be affected by this observation. However, it is expected to be different in the shoulder kinematics with increased muscular effort; as previously shown, reduced maximal isometric force is generated in arm elevation in patients with supraspinatus tendinopathy. This suggestion should be further evaluated in future studies. Future research could utilize the presented, easily available evaluation method on shoulder kinematics under low-effort conditions as a benchmark for assessing patients with painful shoulders due to supraspinatus tendon full-thickness tear during higher-effort activities. This might enable more effective treatment decisions, advance the understanding and treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathies, and determine the level of disability in these patients.",0.9505226040235027,0.9505226040235027,0.08708956911537319,0.08708956911537319,0.6406888918025206,0.6406888918025206,0.5957750559965248,0.5957750559965248,0.7606690090028798,0.685207625047991,0.6949781875516664,0.6496883932988673,0.6836557389884665,4
PMC12093602,Return to sports following arthroscopic Bankart repair: a narrative review.,2024,"A Bankart lesion is a tear of the labrum, the ring of cartilage that encircles
the shoulder joint socket, that can occur when the shoulder is dislocated. This
injury frequently affects young athletes and is associated with shoulder
instability. This review was performed to provide an overview of anterior
shoulder instability, with an emphasis on rehabilitation and the return to
sports following arthroscopic Bankart repair. We searched the Google Scholar and
PubMed academic databases through February 18th, 2024, utilizing keywords
including “arthroscopic Bankart repair” and “return to
sports”. Our findings indicate that athletes who undergo arthroscopic
Bankart repair exhibit higher rates of returning to sports compared to those who
receive other anterior shoulder stabilization procedures. Several factors are
considered when determining readiness to return to athletics, including time
elapsed since surgery, type of sport, strength, range of motion, pain, and
proprioception. Surgeons typically advise athletes to wait approximately 6
months after surgery before resuming sports activities. They also recommend that
athletes regain at least 80% of the strength of the uninjured shoulder or
achieve strength levels comparable to those prior to the injury. Additionally,
patients are expected to attain a full range of motion without pain, which
should be symmetrical to the uninjured side, and demonstrate improved
proprioception in the shoulder. The sport in which an athlete participates can
also influence the timeline for return. Those involved in overhead sports, like
baseball or tennis, often experience lower success rates in returning to their
sport compared to athletes from other disciplines. Conclusion ABR results in a high percentage of athletes returning to athletic activities,
leading to the development of various criteria to support the RTP. Most surgeons
advise athletes to wait 6 months after surgery before resuming sports, to regain
at least 80% of the strength in the contralateral limb or a level of strength
comparable to that prior to the injury, to achieve a full or symmetrical ROM
without pain, and to demonstrate improved shoulder proprioception. However, the
type of sport also influences the rate of RTS, with overhead sports displaying
the lowest return rates. While many athletes successfully return to their
previous level of competition, some may experience adverse psychological
responses during the process.",0.5164380236532927,0.5164380236532927,0.5576850303861979,0.5576850303861979,0.5876588968763844,0.5876588968763844,0.6268261445918638,0.6268261445918638,0.5976720275340305,0.6270547381421434,0.5852994767843372,0.4720003742759503,0.5569747011572405,4
PMC11294519,Proximal humerus fracture and acromioclavicular joint dislocation.,2024,"Abstract Proximal humerus fractures and injuries to the acromioclavicular joint are among the most common traumatic diseases of the upper extremity. Fractures of the proximal humerus occur most frequently in older people and are an indicator fracture of osteoporosis. While a large proportion of only slightly displaced fractures can be treated non-operatively, more complex fractures require surgical treatment. The choice of optimal treatment and the decision between joint-preserving surgery by means of osteosynthesis or endoprosthetic treatment is often a difficult decision in which both fracture morphology factors and individual factors should be taken into account. If endoprosthetic treatment is indicated, satisfactory long-term functional and clinical results have been achieved with a reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Injuries to the acromioclavicular joint occur primarily in young, athletic individuals. The common classification according to Rockwood divides the injury into 6 degrees of severity depending on the dislocation. This classification forms the basis for the decision on non-operative or surgical treatment. The indication for surgical treatment for higher-grade injuries is the subject of controversial debate in the latest literature. In chronic injuries, an autologous tendon transplant is also performed. Whereas in the past, treatment was often carried out using a hook plate, which was associated with complications, the gold standard today is minimally invasive treatment using Endobutton systems. This review provides an overview of the two injury patterns and discusses the various treatment options. Conclusions AC joint injuries are a common pathology to the shoulder girdle. It mainly affects young and athletically active men. The therapy depends on the age of the injury (acute or chronic) and the Rockwood type. In recent years, arthroscopically supported Endobutton systems have become established for surgical treatment. In this way, additional horizontal stabilization can be ensured, which is decisive for the postoperative functional result. In addition, glenohumeral concomitant pathologies can be detected and addressed if necessary. Due to a decreasing healing potential of the ligaments in chronic AC joint instabilities, an additional reinforcement with an autologous tendon (Hamstring tendons) is performed.",0.5024337264143709,0.5024337264143709,0.0,0.0,0.5168716716234812,0.5168716716234812,0.4870543888369245,0.4870543888369245,0.6273700677369309,0.5042262559234397,0.4819204580592407,0.5890539325006777,0.5087038266696,4
PMC11362632,Repair of an Isolated Sternal Head Tear of the Myotendinous Junction of the Pectoralis Major Using Knotless Suture Anchors: Case Report and Literature Review.,2024,"Although considered a relatively uncommon sports injury, publications on pectoralis major (PM) injuries have increased in the last couple of decades. Knowledge of the complex anatomy of the PM muscle is important in diagnosing, understanding the complexity of the injury, and determining the suitable modality of management of these injuries. Despite the increase in publications, there is no consensus on the superiority of any proposed surgical management. We present a case of a recreational body builder who presented to our clinics with a rare pattern of isolated musculotendinous junction of the lower fibers of the PM muscle and proposed a new technique of surgical management of such injuries using knotless suture anchors and running locked suture pattern in different directions. We then conducted a comprehensive review of literature of these injuries and presented a review on the pathophysiology, the various patterns of these injuries, and the available described modalities of surgical management. Understanding the complex anatomy of the PM, the various pattens of injury, and the aid of an MRI read by an expert musculoskeletal radiologist is crucial before managing these injuries. We believe that acute surgical repair of musculotendinous junction injuries using running Krackow/Brunnell locked configuration and the use of knotless suture and anchors will provide adequate and practicable surgical repair of these injuries. Conclusions Based on the current available evidence, we propose a new technique for the repair of sternocostal myotendinous junction using running Kruckow/Brunell stitch and knotless anchor sutures and structure-to-structure direct repair. The use of knotless suture anchors has not been described before. We believe that this technique is reproducible, minimizes the risk of failure by both suture pullout and suture breakage, and allows for gradual and better tensioning of the stump back to the tendon footprint. On the contrary, the pull out strength and the best type of anchors to be used should be subjected to further studying. Nevertheless, despite the significant increase in publication on these injuries within the last decade, we still lack clinical studies comparing the different methods of surgical fixation and stitch configuration for different types of PM injuries.",0.5261364532289544,0.5261364532289544,0.3377660323339121,0.3377660323339121,0.41672169245095786,0.41672169245095786,0.45274341255874073,0.45274341255874073,0.3780324382253774,0.4545703088073699,0.46937461016742416,0.3569941573333991,0.4412794969589179,4
PMC12454330,Recent advances in gradient biomimetic scaffolds for tendon-bone interface regeneration.,2025,"Injury and repair of the tendon-bone interface (TBI) pose a significant challenge in the fields of orthopedics and sports medicine. Due to the gradients in structure, composition, mechanical properties, and biological signals across the TBI, transitioning from flexible tendon to rigid bone, traditional surgical approaches often struggle to reconstruct its functional structure, leading to poor mechanical properties of the interface after repair and high re-tear rates. In contrast, gradient biomimetic scaffolds, by mimicking the continuous gradients of native TBI, offer an effective solution for achieving functional TBI regeneration. This review systematically summarizes the research progress of gradient biomimetic scaffolds for TBI regeneration in recent years. Firstly, we discuss the fine structure, physiological functions of native TBI, and the repair challenges faced after its injury, emphasizing the necessity of reconstructing gradient structures. Subsequently, it focuses on the design principles and core biomimetic strategies of gradient biomimetic scaffolds, discussing in depth the principles of construction and implementation strategies for physical structure gradients (e.g., porosity, fiber orientation, mechanical modulus), chemical composition gradients (e.g., degree of mineralization, polymer/ECM components), and biological signal gradients (e.g., growth factors, genes). Building upon this, this review comprehensively reviews various biomaterials for gradient scaffold construction, including natural polymers (collagen, silk fibroin, chitosan, etc.), synthetic polymers (PCL, PLGA, PU, etc.), and inorganic bioactive materials (calcium phosphate ceramics, bioactive glass), analyzing their characteristics, functionalization methods, and applications in gradient construction. Furthermore, this review also systematically summarizes and compares major fabrication techniques for gradient biomimetic scaffolds, particularly the advantages and limitations of electrospinning and additive manufacturing (3D printing) in constructing specific gradient features, and highlights emerging techniques such as microfluidics. Finally, building upon the summarized existing research findings, this review critically analyzes the key challenges and technical bottlenecks currently facing gradient biomimetic scaffolds regarding structural biomimetic accuracy, spatio-temporal control of biological functions, vascularization, and immunocompatibility, and offers perspectives on future research directions, such as smart scaffolds, integration of multiple gradients, personalized manufacturing, and clinical translation strategies. 7 Conclusion Regenerating the complex tendon-bone interface (TBI) remains a significant challenge. Gradient biomimetic scaffolds offer a sophisticated strategy, mimicking the TBI’s native structural and biological gradients to guide organized tissue formation. While advanced fabrication techniques show promise in constructing these architectures using diverse biomaterials, critical hurdles persist. Achieving high-fidelity biomimicry, ensuring long-term stability, and promoting vascularization are paramount. Future innovations in smart materials and focused translational studies are essential to unlock the full clinical potential of these scaffolds for robust and functional TBI regeneration, moving beyond preclinical successes towards tangible patient benefits.",0.2617670041967423,0.2617670041967423,0.06337063246733157,0.06337063246733157,0.0,0.0,0.016964350856960204,0.016964350856960204,0.06926621622230761,0.1042884206449947,0.14524133143481702,0.002516077162546517,0.1095600178667494,4

In this, we discussed the comprehensive assessment and management of a 22-year-old male patient who is a student by occupation and a recreational badminton player who presented with left shoulder and wrist pain following a road traffic accident. The study highlights the clinical findings, diagnostic assessment, and therapeutic interventions for the patient with volar intercalated segment instability and a grade 1 AC joint sprain. The methodology involves a case report of the patient’s clinical evaluation, including range of motion, manual muscle testing, and diagnostic imaging. The patient was managed conservatively with physiotherapy interventions, including Mulligan’s movement with mobilization, cryotherapy, light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, and progressive exercises. The results of the study demonstrate the successful implementation of a multidisciplinary conservative management approach for alleviating pain, restoring function, and promoting optimal recovery for the patient. The implications of the study underscore the significance of tailored physical therapy rehabilitation in the management of AC joint sprains and wrist instabilities. Conclusions This report highlights the case of a 22-year-old male patient who injured his shoulder and wrist following an RTA. His clinical assessment identified a grade 1 AC joint sprain and VISI at the wrist. A multidisciplinary conservative management approach by the medical team, along with tailored physical therapy rehabilitation, was implemented to alleviate pain, restore function, and promote optimal recovery for the patient. This case adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions in the conservative management of AC joint sprains and carpal instabilities, advocating for a patient-centered approach in the rehabilitation process.

PMC11855343,Effects of Pilates Training Combined with Fascial Massage on Upper Cross Syndrome in Office Workers.,2025,"Objective: Upper crossed syndrome (UCS) is an abnormal upper extremity movement pattern characterized by muscle tightness in the neck, shoulders, and upper back, coupled with weakness in opposing muscle groups. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Pilates training combined with fascial massage as an intervention in office workers with UCS. Methods: 34 subjects were recruited and randomly divided into an experimental group (n = 17) and a control group (n = 17). The control group underwent 12 weeks of Pilates training, and the experimental group received 12 weeks of Pilates training combined with fascial massage. Body posture was assessed using the forward head angle (FHA) and forward shoulder angle (FSA), joint mobility was evaluated using cervical spine range of motion (ROM), muscle activity was assessed using surface electromyography (sEMG), and quality of life was evaluated using pain level (VAS) and cervical spine dysfunction index (NDI). Results: After 12 weeks of intervention, the FHA, FSA, VAS, and NDI of the experimental group were significantly lower than those of the pre-intervention group ( p < 0.05) and significantly lower than those of the control group ( p < 0.05); the extension and left–right rotation cervical spine ROM of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the pre-intervention group ( p < 0.05) and significantly higher than those of the control group ( p < 0.05); and sEMG indexes (mean power frequency and median frequency) of the upper trapezius and the pectoralis major in the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the pre-intervention group ( p < 0.05) and significantly higher than the control group ( p < 0.05). Conclusion: Compared with Pilates training alone, Pilates training combined with fascial massage demonstrated a more significant effect in improving muscle activation, body posture, and pain and enhancing the quality of life for patients with UCS. 5. Conclusions This study investigated the effects of Pilates training alone and combined with fascial massage on individuals with upper cross syndrome (UCS). Both interventions significantly improved flexibility, muscle activation patterns, pain, and cervical spine dysfunction. However, Pilates combined with fascial massage demonstrated superior flexibility, muscle activation, and pain reduction outcomes. This synergistic effect is likely due to the combined benefits of muscle strengthening, increased flexibility, and improved blood circulation provided by both interventions.",0.31793996023374854,0.31793996023374854,0.30631169115209533,0.30631169115209533,0.31183341228914874,0.31183341228914874,0.2736326821498706,0.2736326821498706,0.3250840071323736,0.31902200307161815,0.3447234202117228,0.3779301758629941,0.3530251091245406,4

It is the most strenuous stroke in the game and has the greatest potential for injury. The serve has been broken down into a number of key stages to allow analysis of the movements involved. Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of all injuries related to the stages of the tennis serve and to assess their relative impact on the risk of injury using a meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic search was conducted across 8 electronic databases, supplemented with searches of grey literature. Eligible studies presented data from injured (injury group) and uninjured (control group) tennis players in a form that allowed further analysis of each risk factor for comparison. All results were presented as effect sizes (Cohen’s d ) to allow comparison of each risk factor and to identify the most important risk factors associated with injury. Overall study quality was assessed using an adapted Downs and Blacks checklist. Results: A total of 29 studies were included in the meta-analysis, identifying 130 risk factors. 36 risk factors had an effect size suggesting a large or significant association with injury in tennis players ( d ⩾ 0.8 or ⩽−0.8). These were divided into general risk factors and those associated with the preparation, acceleration and follow-through phases of the tennis serve. Seven of the risk factors were from 3 or more studies allowing meta-analysis, 3 were from 2 studies and 26 were from a single study. Downs and Black checklist scores ranged from fair to good for the studies included in this review. There was no evidence of publication bias.

Arthroscopy may offer superior visualization and advantages that limit these risks. The aim of this prospective non-randomized study is to evaluate advantages and long-term reliability of arthroscopic AC stabilization. Methods Thirty-two patients with acute grade III, IV and V AC dislocations underwent arthroscopic AC reconstruction with long-term assessment by clinical AC examination, Simple Shoulder Test, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores, visual analog scale, Specific AC Score and Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores. Radiographs verified conservation of initial reduction and presence of coracoclavicular (CC) ossifications. Complications, revision rate, and satisfaction were assessed and compared to the literature. Results Mean follow-up time was 67.6 months. All clinical outcome scores improved and differences were statistically significant (P<0.001). Initial postoperative radiographs consistently showed complete reduction. Two patients experienced relapse to grade II AC dislocation without clinical implications. In total, 71.8% showed CC ossifications without functional impairment, and in 31.3% concomitant injuries were observed. Reintervention rate was 9.4%, and 96.9% of patients were satisfied with procedure outcomes.

PMC11617340,Effect of Shoulder Flexion Range of Motion and Trunk Muscle Activity on Lumbar Lordosis in the Streamlined Posture in Healthy Young Men.,2024,"Objective This study aimed to compare the lumbar spine, pelvic alignment, and trunk muscle activity in healthy participants with and without shoulder flexion restriction in a streamlined posture. Methods The lumbar lordosis angle, pelvic anteversion angle, and trunk muscle activity were measured in 31 young, healthy men in the resting standing position. The streamlined (SL) posture and correlation analysis were performed. Multiple regression analysis was performed to analyze variables that affect the lumbar lordosis angle in the SL posture. Results Correlation analysis revealed that the lumbar lordosis angle in the SL posture had a significant negative correlation with the muscle activity of the internal oblique/transversus abdominis muscle (IO/TrA) during the SL posture (r=-0.37, p<0.045). Multiple regression analysis revealed that lumbar lordosis angle in the SL posture was associated with lumbar lordosis angle in the upright position (β=0.46), IO/TrA activity (β=-0.37), shoulder joint flexion range of motion (β=-0.37), and longissimus dorsi muscle activity during the SL posture (β=-0.28), with a Durbin-Watson statistic adjusted coefficient of determination R 2 of 0.67 (p<0.001). Conclusion The lumbar lordosis angle in the SL posture was likely to be high when the range of motion of shoulder joint flexion was small, the activity of the longissimus dorsi muscle in the SL posture was high, and the activity of the IO/TrA was low. This suggests that limited shoulder flexion causes excessive lumbar lordosis, which may be a mechanism of low back pain in swimmers. Conclusions In this study, we investigated the effects of shoulder flexion ROM, pelvic anteversion angle, and trunk muscle activity on lumbar lordosis angle in the SL posture in young, healthy male participants without functional impairment such as joint ROM limitation or muscle weakness except in the shoulder joint. The lumbar lordosis angle in the SL posture is likely to increase when the shoulder flexion angle is small, the activity of the LT is high, and the activity of the IO/TrA is low.

PMC10849064,Rehabilitation of Supraspinatus Impingement in a Volleyball Athlete: A Case Report.,2024,"Volleyball players with supraspinatus tendinopathy commonly present with a spectrum of symptoms, including shoulder pain, especially during the overhead phases of the game. They may experience pain during serves, spikes, or attempting to block at the net. Weakness in the affected shoulder and limited range of motion can impede performance and overall playing experience. Physiotherapy plays a crucial role in managing supraspinatus tendinopathy, focusing on reducing pain, improving shoulder joint range and function, and preventing recurrence. The research question arises as to how the rehabilitation process impacts the recovery and performance outcomes in a volleyball athlete with supraspinatus impingement which is explained as detailed in a case report. The present case is a 21-year-old male volleyball athlete complaining of pain in the anterolateral and posterior aspects of the right shoulder joint and a restricted range of motion while doing abduction and flexion at the shoulder joint for three months.

PMC11329032,Management of posttraumatic posterior shoulder instability following a Latarjet: a case report.,2024,"Discussion and conclusion Treatment for recurrent shoulder instability is guided by a variety of factors. The ideal plan correctly pairs surgical technique with the underlying pathology in order to restore anatomical function. Determining the extent of soft tissue and bony involvement is crucial to creating a successful treatment plan, as these have widely differing contributions to instability due to their differing anatomical defects. Arthroscopic Bankart repairs are generally considered first line surgical management for recurrent anterior instability with soft tissue damage to the labrum and minimal (<20%) glenoid bone loss. 1 Similarly, surgical management of tears in the glenohumeral ligament target the soft tissue defects within the joint. Soft tissue procedures are often preferred because complications are frequently less severe and more easily corrected than complications of bone augmentation procedures. However, the Bankart repair and similar soft tissue techniques are inferior to bone augmentation when there is significant bony involvement, as they do not address the bony anatomic defects. Though there is some debate as to the exact amount of glenoid bone loss that should be considered “critical” and how large on and off-track Hill-Sachs lesions must be to warrant fixation, there is universal agreement that they are important factors that contribute to recurrent anterior instability. 4 , 5 , 6 , 13 , 17 , 20 , 25 Generally, 20-25% bone loss is considered enough to warrant bone augmentation, usually in the form of a bone graft or remplissage, with some surgeons even recommending a critical value as low as 17.3% ( 3 , 17 , 26 , 27 ). The Latarjet procedure is well-established as a first line surgical treatment for recurrent anterior shoulder instability with significant osseous defects and is often recommended to patients who are young and active, especially in contact sports since it has a substantially lower risk of recurrent instability compared to soft tissue procedures alone. 2 , 10 , 14 , 29 Just as with recurrent anterior instability, the principles of treating recurrent posterior shoulder instability should focus on correcting the underlying pathology and restoring normal anatomy. However, this is often difficult as there is more ambiguity in treatment guidelines as well as a relative scarcity of posterior dislocations, and therefore surgeon experience. 8 , 18 Arthroscopic reverse Bankart repairs, capsular plications, and repairs of the posterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament can be effectively utilized in patients with subcritical (generally regarded as <20%) glenoid bone loss with high success rates 9 While associated with relatively high failure rates, posterior bone block procedures should be considered in the presence of critical (>20-25%) glenoid bone loss or large humeral head lesions and can utilize grafts from the iliac crest, distal tibia, scapular spine, or femur. 6 , 19 After a thorough search, there is only one reported case of ipsilateral anterior and posterior shoulder dislocations. The reported patient was a 23-year-old male who was already set to have a posterior shoulder stabilization surgery when he was in a motor vehicle accident and suffered an ipsilateral anterior shoulder dislocation. To address both problems at the same time, an arthroscopically assisted Latarjet with posterior bone graft was performed. To the authors’ knowledge, that type of procedure had not been performed before. 7 Our case is different as the time between the anterior glenoid and posterior glenoid augmentation was separated by several years and both were the result of separate traumatic injuries. This case report shows that, when correctly utilized, anterior and posterior bony augmentation procedures can provide satisfactory outcomes, even allowing athletes to return to preinjury participation levels in high impact sports. Though often avoided for fear of complications and technical difficulty, this case demonstrates that correctly addressing underlying pathology with the most direct anatomical corrections can provide great outcomes and should be considered when managing recurrent anterior and posterior shoulder instability. Though Bankart and similar soft tissue techniques should be utilized when addressing primarily soft tissue injuries, bone augmentation must be considered when bone loss is apparent. There are no reported cases of an ipsilateral posterior dislocation after a Latarjet, so there is an obvious need for more patients to be studied before making conclusions regarding the long-term effectiveness of posterior bone grafting, especially when a Latarjet has already been performed. However, considering that our patient has had zero episodes of recurrent instability (defined as subluxations or dislocations) in the ten years that have elapsed since surgery and that most recurrent dislocations occur in the first two years after the initial dislocation, we believe that this case report can provide a helpful guide to surgeons managing anterior and posterior shoulder instability with bone loss. 11",1.0,1.0,0.36868229332995217,0.36868229332995217,0.7641400094367697,0.7641400094367697,0.6849525747696257,0.6849525747696257,0.9114052358745075,0.8423955809256426,0.8055025309528349,0.7384620856272888,0.7887424196214483,4
PMC12360938,The Ergogenic Effects of Intermittent Palm Cooling on Repeated Baseball Throwing Are Reversed when Cooling-Induced Pain Occurs.,2025,"Intermittent palm cooling (PC) could benefit strength performance. However, its effect on baseball throwing, which requires explosive strength, has yet to be determined. This study aimed to examine whether intermittent PC would enhance repeated baseball throwing performance and how pain after PC would affect outcomes. Twenty-two university division II male baseball athletes were instructed to perform five sets of 10 throws at maximum speed toward a target, separated by 3-min of recovery with PC into 10°C water or non-cooling (NC). Participants were classified into the no-pain group (NPG, n = 10) and mild-to-moderate pain group (PG, n = 12) according to their pain sensation after PC for data analysis. The results showed a significantly lower rating of perceived exertion under PC conditions (p < 0.05). In the NPG, PC resulted in higher mean throw velocity (107.9 ± 9.9 vs. 106.9 ± 10.2 km/h), maximal throw velocity (112.5 ± 9.0 vs. 111.2 ± 9.8 km/h), accuracy, and the arousal level than NC; in the PG, PC resulted in lower mean throw velocity (101.0 ± 11.1 vs. 105.2 ± 10.5 km/h) and maximal throw velocity (105.0 ± 10.8 vs. 108.7 ± 9.8 km/h) when compared with NC (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was noted in accuracy and arousal levels between PC and NC (p > 0.05) in the PG. In conclusion, after PC, pain-free baseball athletes can enhance their baseball throwing performance. The presence or absence of pain after PC can serve as an initial assessment of whether to use it as an ergogenic aid strategy. Conclusions In conclusion, intermittent PC reduces perceived exertion during baseball throwing regardless of whether trained baseball players experience cooling-induced light-to-moderate pain. Furthermore, for trained baseball players who do not feel pain during intermittent PC treatment, inter-set PC (10°C, 2.5 min) elicits higher arousal levels, greater mean throwing velocity, higher maximal throwing velocity, and better throwing accuracy during repeated baseball throwing. However, intermittent PC does not provide an ergogenic effect in well-trained baseball players who experience cooling-induced pain during repeated baseball throwing. Additionally, athletes exhibit decreased mean throwing velocity and maximal throwing velocity. The findings of this study show that a pain-free baseball player from PC could use PC as an ergogenic aid to enhance baseball throwing performance; the presence or absence of pain after PC can serve as an initial assessment of whether to use PC as an ergogenic aid strategy.",0.5903447360478689,0.5903447360478689,0.5028407143946738,0.5028407143946738,0.3976020906838625,0.3976020906838625,0.5005475670564411,0.5005475670564411,0.3386698073662279,0.3547569237530397,0.5012743172547874,0.2611660262081297,0.441247244493123,4
PMC11809631,Neck pain and distance learning: A pain in the neck for university students during COVID-19.,2024,"Objective The shift to online learning during COVID-19 led to increased musculoskeletal discomforts and impacted students’ quality of life. Neck pain (NP), once a minor issue, has become more prevalent due to prolonged electronic device use in new learning methods. This study aims to measure the prevalence of NP among University of Sharjah (UOS) students during the COVID-19 online learning period and to investigate the factors that provoked it. Methods This study focused on young adult students aged 17-26 and did not consider gender or athletic status due to the university’s demographics and pandemic restrictions. Demographic data, Neck Disability Index (NDI) assessments, and pain management information were gathered and analyzed using SPSS 24 through univariate and bivariate methods. Results The prevalence of NP during COVID-19, among 325 UOS students was found to be 62.7%, 64.41% of which had NP at the time of doing the survey. NDI scores were found to be skewed. The median was 16% which indicates mild NP while the interquartile range was 19.11. Most participants reported experiencing posterior neck pain (38.77%), primarily attributed to prolonged sitting (81.23%). Factors such as lifting, personal care, and emotional well-being were found to have a significant impact on NDI. Participants who did not seek medical attention exhibited significantly higher levels of neck pain disability, as measured by the NDI. The median NDI score for this group was 20, with an interquartile range of 16.89 while, those who sought medical attention had a higher median NDI score of 34 with interquartile range of 22. Conclusion This study highlights the prevalence of neck pain among UOS students, emphasizing the need for postural improvements and further research on prevention strategies in the UAE.

PMC12030932,Thermography in Bike Fitting: A Literature Review.,2025,"Cycling comfort significantly impacts both enjoyment and performance, with discomfort potentially leading to injuries. Traditional bike-fitting methods, while effective for biomechanical adjustments, often overlook physiological responses such as pressure distribution and asymmetry. Infrared thermography (IRT), a non-invasive technique analyzing surface temperature variations, offers the potential to enhance bike fitting by identifying pressure points, asymmetries, and discomfort zones. This review evaluates the application of IRT in bike fitting, highlighting its ability to provide objective, real-time insights into cyclist comfort and injury prevention. However, limitations such as variability in thermographic protocols and the lack of standardized methodologies necessitate further research. By addressing these gaps, IRT could transform bike fitting into a more precise, personalized, and effective practice for cyclists across all levels. 5. Conclusions This paper has highlighted the potential of IRT as a valuable addition to current bike-fitting practices. While traditional methods focus primarily on biomechanical alignment, IRT offers a non-invasive means to capture physiological responses such as pressure distribution and asymmetry, factors closely linked to comfort and injury risk. By providing real-time, objective insights that go beyond what kinematic analysis can reveal, IRT can enhance the precision and effectiveness of rider assessments. Its integration into bike fitting, however, depends on the development of standardized protocols for measurement, interpretation, and application. With such frameworks in place, IRT could play a key role in advancing towards a more holistic, data-driven approach to cycling ergonomics.",0.592667089723271,0.592667089723271,0.017446666575933526,0.017446666575933526,0.016444398507063168,0.016444398507063168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23530033305204678,0.0,0.1764752497890351,4

Methods An expert consensus statement on ASI published by Hurley et al. in 2022 was reviewed and questions laid out to the expert panel were extracted. GPT-4, the subscription version of ChatGPT, was queried using the same set of questions. Answers provided by GPT-4 were compared with those of the expert panel and subjectively rated for similarity by 2 experienced shoulder surgeons. GPT-4 was then used to rate the similarity of its own responses to the consensus statement, classifying them as low, medium, or high. Rates of similarity as classified by the shoulder surgeons and GPT-4 were then compared and interobserver reliability calculated using weighted κ scores. Results The degree of similarity between responses of GPT-4 and the ASI consensus statement, as defined by shoulder surgeons, was high in 25.8%, medium in 45.2%, and low 29% of questions. GPT-4 assessed similarity as high in 48.3%, medium in 41.9%, and low 9.7% of questions. Surgeons and GPT-4 reached consensus on the classification of 18 questions (58.1%) and disagreement on 13 questions (41.9%). Conclusions The responses generated by artificial intelligence exhibit limited correlation with an expert statement on the diagnosis and treatment of ASI.

Rowers are at increased risk of muscle fatigue and injury during high-repetition and heavy-load cyclic muscle actions. In view of this, the aim of the present study was to investigate the acute effect on muscle tone and stiffness, as well as bilateral muscle asymmetry, in high school rowers after a 2000-meter rowing ergometer test. Methods Twelve young male rowers (age = 17.1 ± 0.9 years, body weight = 73.5 ± 9.7 kg) were included in the study. The data of muscle tone (frequency) and stiffness of the posterior deltoids (PD), latissimus dorsi (LD), and rectus femoris (RF) (dominant and non-dominant side) before and after a 2000-m rowing ergometer test were collected using a handheld MyotonPRO device. Results After the rowing ergometer test, the muscle tone of dominant side PD, LD, and RF were significantly increased ( p < 0.05). On the other hand, the muscle stiffness of the non-dominant side LD and RF, as well as the dominant side PD, LD, and RF were significantly increased after the rowing ergometer test ( p < 0.05). The muscle tone and stiffness results showed that the dominant side PD, LD, and RF were all significantly higher than the non-dominant side after the rowing ergometer test ( p < 0.05), where bilateral PD and RF exhibits moderate asymmetry (5% < symmetry index < 10%). Conclusions After a high-intensity and high-load 2000-m rowing ergometer test, PD, LD, and RF showed increases in muscle tone and stiffness, as well as changes in the symmetry of bilateral muscle mechanical properties.

The aim of this study was to compare the mid-term clinical and sonographic treatment outcomes after minimally invasive mini-open and arthroscopic reconstruction. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective two-center study of patients with acute ACJ dislocation. Surgical treatment was performed using either a mini-open approach (MIOP) or an arthroscopic technique (AR). The primary outcome parameters of this study were the sonographically measured acromioclavicular (ACD) and coracoclavicular distances (CCD). Secondary outcome parameters included the Constant–Murley score (CS), range of motion (ROM), postoperative pain scale (VAS), return to daily routine, return to sports, complications, as well as operative revisions. Results After a mean follow-up of 29 months, 30 patients were included in this study with an average age of 41.3 ± 14.8 years (MIOP) and 41.2 ± 15.4 years (AR). The sonographic ACD (MIOP 9.11 mm vs. AR 8.93 mm, p = 0.41) and CCD (MIOP 25.08 mm vs. AR 24.36 mm, p = 0.29) distances showed no statistically significant differences. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference when compared to the contralateral side ( p = 0.42).

PMC10519522,Treatment of glenohumeral internal rotation deficit in the general population with shoulder pain: An open single-arm clinical trial.,2023,"Background: Maladaptation can provoke important alterations in the arthrokinematics such as an internal rotation reduction in the dominant shoulder compared with the nondominant shoulder known as glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD). Though the number of studies investigating GIRD in athletic population, there are not studies reporting the efficacy of the GIRD treatment in the nonathlete population, a kind of study required to improve our understanding of patient care with this pathology. This study aimed to describe the efficacy of the GIRD treatment in nonathlete population with shoulder pain. Methods: An open single-arm trial with 35 patients was adopted for evaluating the efficacy of GIRD treatment in patients with shoulder pain. All patients with shoulder pain who attended the consultation, accepted, and agreed to participate in the study between October 2020 and March 2021 were included. A treatment sequence including joint manual therapy techniques and soft tissue release techniques was applied in the consultation. Then, patients were instructed to adapt the daily active biological stimulus at home. The IR before (IR 0 ) and after (IR 1 ) the treatment was considered the outcome measure. The GIRD was calculated as the difference between the IR of the non-painful shoulder and the IR of the painful shoulder before (GIRD 0 ) and after treatment (GIRD 1 ). A paired Student t test was used to compare the GIRD of each patient before and after the treatment. Results: Treatment of the patients significantly increased the IR of the painful shoulder in all the patients ( P -value < .0001) So, the mean IR 0 was 26.09 ± 14.46º (23.64–28.53), and after the treatment the mean IR 1 was 67.98 ± 15.03º (65.48–70.52). The mean difference after the treatment (IR 1 –IR 0 ) was 41.89 ± 14.74º (39.4–44.39). The treatment also significantly reduced GIRD ( P -value < .0001). So, the mean GIRD 0 was 42.95 ± 16.26º (40.2–45.7), and after the treatment the mean GIRD 1 was –1.05 ± 17.18º (–3.96 to 1.85). Conclusions: The treatment administrated in this study significantly increased the internal rotation of the treated and painful shoulder and reduced the GIRD from the first consultation.

PMC11784286,Clinical and radiological evaluation of the Bristow-Latarjet procedure in patients with 30 or more years of follow-up.,2025,"Background The Bristow–Latarjet surgery is the procedure most performed for recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation. There are few studies with a follow-up of more than 20 years. Because it is a nonanatomical technique, there is interest in knowing the clinical and radiological results and the rates of complications in the long term. Methods We performed a retrospective case series study. Patients with recurrent anterior dislocation of the shoulder who underwent the Bristow–Latarjet procedure were included and followed-up clinically for at least 30 years. We evaluated clinical scores—the Rowe, Western Ontario Shoulder Instability, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and visual analog scale—as well as clinical outcomes: the recurrency (dislocation or subluxation) and seizure. Screw and graft positioning were assessed by computed tomography, the degree of arthropathy by radiography, and subscapularis fatty degeneration as rotator cuff tears by magnetic resonance imaging. Both clinical scores and imaging were obtained at 30 years of surgery. Results Twenty-seven patients (30 shoulders) were evaluated, with a mean follow-up of 35 ± 4.5 years. The scores obtained were 88.28 ± 15.9 by Rowe, 208 ± 244.2 by the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability examination, 92.5% ± 10.4% by the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and 0.45 ± 1.3 by the visual analog scale. The recurrence rate was 13.3%, with all patients presenting subluxations and no new dislocations. All grafts were positioned below the glenoid equator. In 82.4% of the cases, the grafts were aligned with the articular surface, 5.9% were medially deviated, and 11.8% were laterally deviated. Consolidation occurred in 76.5% of the cases. The screws presented bicortical fixation in 76.5% of the shoulders and inclination in the axial plane of less than 15° in 64.7%. A total of 58.8% of the cases presented with glenohumeral arthropathy, and 75% of the magnetic resonance imagings showed the absence of fatty degeneration. Conclusion Bristow–Latarjet surgery demonstrates excellent clinical results in most patients after 30 years of follow-up. The recurrence rate is low, as is the complication rate. Glenohumeral arthropathy occurs in most patients without significant clinical repercussions.

PMC10467408,Midterm Clinical Outcomes After Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair in Olympic Volleyball Players: Return to Sports and Return to Performance.,2023,"Background: The decision-making process and predicting the time to return to sport (RTS) and return to performance (RTP) after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) in elite volleyball players are difficult issues to address, even among experienced shoulder surgeons. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the results in Olympic-level volleyball players treated with arthroscopic supraspinatus repair and to report the RTS and the RTP. It was hypothesized that these athletes had higher RTS and faster RTP. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: This study included 17 elite volleyball athletes (11 male, 6 female; mean age, 26.2 years) who underwent ARCR for partial- and full-thickness supraspinatus tears that did not improve despite nonoperative treatment. The clinical results were evaluated at 12 months postoperatively. The authors compared the athletes’ preoperative, 6-month, and 12-month Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic (KJOC) scores and the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain after competition and conducted 6- and 12-month isometric strength analyses. The athletes’ RTS and RTP times were recorded. Results: All tears were on the dominant side (15 right, 2 left), and 82% were partial tears (14 partial thickness, 3 full thickness). The mean time from the onset of symptoms to surgery was 11.3 ± 6.7 months. While the mean Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic score was 31 preoperatively, it was 89 after 6 months ( P < .001 vs preoperative) and 96 after 12 months ( P = .003 vs 6 months). The mean VAS for pain was 7.9 preoperatively, 0.4 at 6 months ( P < .001 vs preoperative), and 0.1 at 12 months ( P = .02 vs 6 months). All athletes were able to reach their preinjury level, with RTS at a mean of 6.9 months and RTP at a mean of 12.4 months. Conclusion: ARCR appears to be an effective option for Olympic-level volleyball players who do not benefit from nonoperative treatment. All athletes returned to their preinjury level of sports.

PMC9897004,Bodyblade™ Training in Athletes with Traumatic Anterior Shoulder Instability.,2023,"Background The Bodyblade™ has the potential of enhancing conservative management of Traumatic Anterior Shoulder Instability (TASI). Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare three different protocols: Traditional, Bodyblade™, and Mixed (Traditional & Bodyblade™) for shoulder rehabilitation on athletes with TASI. Study Design Randomized-controlled longitudinal training study. Methods Thirty-seven athletes (age = 19.9±2.0 years) were allocated into Traditional, Bodyblade™, and Mixed (Traditional/Bodyblade™) training groups (3×week for 8-weeks). The traditional group used resistance bands (10-15 repetitions). The Bodyblade™ group transitioned from classic to the pro model (30-60-s repetitions). The mixed group converted from the traditional (weeks 1-4) to the Bodyblade™ (weeks 5-8) protocol. Western Ontario Shoulder Index (WOSI) and the UQYBT were evaluated at baseline, mid-test, post-test, and at a three-month follow-up. A repeated-measures ANOVA design evaluated within and between-group differences. Results All three groups significantly (p=0.001, eta 2 : 0.496) exceeded WOSI baseline scores (at all timepoints) with training (Traditional: 45.6%, 59.4%, and 59.7%, Bodyblade™: 26.6%, 56.5%, and 58.4%, Mixed: 35.9%, 43.3% and 50.4% respectively). Additionally, there was a significant (p=0.001, eta 2 : 0.607) effect for time with mid-test, post-test and follow-up exceeding baseline scores by 35.2%, 53.2% and 43.7%, respectively. The Traditional and Bodyblade™ groups (p=0.049, eta 2 : 0.130) exceeded the Mixed group UQYBT at post-test (8.4%) and at three-month follow-up (19.6%). A main effect (p=0.03, eta 2 : 0.241) for time indicated that WOSI mid-test, post-test and follow-up exceeded the baseline scores by 4.3%, 6.3% and 5.3%. Conclusions All three training groups improved their scores on the WOSI. The Traditional and Bodyblade™ groups demonstrated significant improvements in UQYBT inferolateral reach scores at post-test and three-month follow-up compared to the Mixed group. These findings could lend further credibility to the role of the Bodyblade as an early to intermediate rehabilitation tool.

Methods Elite-level basketball players who underwent routine, preseason static radiographic imaging, including anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views of the ankle were included. Radiographs were collected from asymptomatic athletes participating in preseason history and physical with negative anterior drawer/talar tilt test. Radiographs were evaluated by a musculoskeletal radiologist and board-certified orthopaedic surgeon; kappa statistics were used to evaluate agreement. Results Fifty-four basketball players (34 collegiate, 20 professional; mean age 21.5 years) were included, totaling 5,148 player exposures from 2017 to 2019. In total, 106 ankles presented with radiographic findings (98.15%). The most prevalent radiographic finding was pes planus (47.22%), followed by degenerative joint disease (DJD; 33.33%), talonavicular sclerosis (28.70%), prominent stieda process (25.93%), os trigonum (20.93%), os subfibulare (11.11%), pes cavus (5.56%), subtalar coalition (2.78%), and cavovarus (0.93%).

PMC11221332,Apprehension-Based Training: A Novel Treatment Concept for Anterior Shoulder Dislocation - A Case Report.,2024,"Background and Purpose Conservative management of anterior shoulder dislocation (ASD) is associated with greater recurrence compared with surgical management. Current rehabilitation protocols may not adequately challenge shoulder stability to encourage adaptive coping strategies. Apprehension-based training (ABT) is a new treatment concept derived from the supine moving apprehension test (SMAT), a previously validated performance measure among patients with ASD. The purpose of this case report is to describe the application of ABT in a patient with recurrent ASD. Study Design Case report Case Description The subject was a 23-year-old male with bilateral recurrent ASD. The subject underwent a 17-week exercise program involving gradual exposure to increased anterior instability loads based on the SMAT movement pattern. The Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI), Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PFPS), Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, SMAT, shoulder internal and external rotation muscle strength were measured via hand-held dynomometry before and after training. Outcomes Following treatment, clinically meaningful gains in quality of life (WOSI) and shoulder function (PSFS) were noted. Kinesiophobia decreased, SMAT and shoulder internal rotator strength increased beyond their respective minimal detectable change. Four months after treatment, quality of life and shoulder function remained improved, and the subject reported a reduced rate of ASD. Discussion Apprehension-based training involving gradual exposure to shoulder instability loads may hold potential for improving the management of patients with ASD. Further testing of this concept is warranted. Level of Evidence 4, single case report CONCLUSION Apprehension-based training, an intervention specifically designed for patients with ASD, was successfully completed by a subject with bilateral recurrent ASD. Clinically meaningful gains in quality of life and functional ability were detected, along with a reduced rate of shoulder dislocations, decreased kinesiophobia, increased willingness to move, and an improved SMAT score. Further study is warranted to explore the feasibility and efficacy of this intervention among patients with ASD.",0.33271353242988766,0.33271353242988766,0.04169890111311808,0.04169890111311808,0.4981471939393443,0.4981471939393443,0.565084651284237,0.565084651284237,0.525292952559855,0.4990359212233511,0.43106037653663254,0.43761268868911346,0.43269845457475276,4

This damages the vascular endothelium, resulting in thrombi, arterial dissection, and aneurysms, a condition known as posterior, circumflex humeral artery pathological lesions. A thrombus may form at the site and becomes a peripheral embolus, resulting in peripheral arterial occlusion.A 21-year-old right-handed elite man college volleyball player noticed coldness and pain in his right hand during a game. Cyanosis was present except in the middle finger, and the beating radial artery was palpable; however, the ulnar artery was not. Doppler ultrasound examination revealed thrombus occlusion of the ulnar artery and common palmar artery of the index finger. Peripheral arterial occlusion was diagnosed due to embolization of a thrombus from this site. The patient stopped practicing volleyball immediately after the onset of symptoms and was started on cilostazol 200 mg and rivaroxaban 15 mg. Subjective coldness of the fingers improved one week after the start of treatment. The patient resumed practice four weeks after the start of treatment and participated in a game by the seventh week.Posterior circumflex humeral artery pathological lesions are caused by overhead motions such as pitching.

PMC10426306,"Republication of ""Stress Fractures of the Foot and Ankle in Athletes"".",2023,"Stress fractures of the foot and ankle are common injuries in athletes. Management differs considerably based on fracture location and predisposing factors. Repetitive loading of the foot and ankle in athletes should result in physiologic bone remodeling in accordance with Wolff’s law. However, when there is not sufficient time for complete healing to occur before additional loads are incurred, this process can instead lead to stress fracture. Assessment of the athlete’s training regimen and overall bone health is paramount to both the discovery and treatment of these injuries, although diagnosis is often delayed in the setting of normal-appearing initial radiographs. While most stress fractures of the foot or ankle can usually be treated nonoperatively with a period of activity modification, fractures in certain locations are considered “high risk” due to poor intrinsic healing and may warrant more proactive operative management.",0.37457674071243224,0.37457674071243224,0.3551393932851867,0.3551393932851867,0.5792836842994937,0.5792836842994937,0.33455470141954885,0.33455470141954885,0.5491588583265242,0.6096441568391966,0.4820318719473121,0.5157557405896306,0.4904628391078917,4
PMC9565175,Exercise Selection and Common Injuries in Fitness Centers: A Systematic Integrative Review and Practical Recommendations.,2022,"Weight resistance training (RT) is an essential component of physical conditioning programs to improve the quality of life and physical fitness in different ages and populations. This integrative review aimed to analyze the scientific evidence on the relationship between exercise selection and the appearance of musculoskeletal injuries in physical fitness centers (PFC). The PubMed or Medline, EMBASE or Science Direct, Google Scholar and PEDro databases were selected to examine the available literature using a Boolean algorithm with search terms. The review process was performed using the five-stage approach for an integrative review and it was reported according to the PRISMA in Exercise, Rehabilitation, Sport Medicine and Sports Science (PERSiST) guidelines. A total of 39 peer-reviewed articles (Price index = 71.7%) met the inclusion criteria and evaluated the link between exercise selection and the incidence of injuries in exercisers who regularly attend PFC. Most injuries occur to the shoulders, elbows, vertebrae of the spine, and knees. Although the injury etiologies are multifactorial, the findings of the reviewed articles include the impacts of overuse, short post-exercise recovery periods, poor conditioning in the exercised body areas, frequent use of heavy loads, improper technique in certain exercises, and the abuse of performance- and image-enhancing drugs. Practical recommendations addressed to clinical exercise physiologists, exercise professionals, and health professionals are given in this paper. The exercise selection in RT programs requires professional supervision and adhering to proper lifting techniques and training habits that consider the anatomical and biomechanical patterns of the musculoskeletal structures, as well as genetic, pedagogical, and methodological aspects directly related to the stimulus–response process to mitigate the occurrence of RT-related injuries in PFC. 5. Conclusions The selection of exercises and their relation to the potential injury risk in the weight RT programs relate to multifactorial inputs that include anatomical and biomechanical patterns of the musculoskeletal structures, as well as genetic, pedagogical, and methodological aspects directly related to the stimulus–response process. The most prevalent injuries occur in the joints of the shoulder, knee, elbow, and vertebrae of the spine. Musculoskeletal pain and injury risk are mostly caused by overuse, short recovery periods between sessions, improper technique, poor conditioning in these body regions, and the frequent use of high loads. Special care should be taken when monitoring PIED users. Besides summarizing the individual characteristics of the selected studies and discussing them as a whole to contribute to the design and development of future research, this paper provides theoretical aspects based on a ‘bio-logic’ approach and practical recommendations addressed to clinical exercise physiologists, exercise professionals, and athletic or personal trainers in order to improve the selection of exercises and mitigate the occurrence of RT-related injuries in PFC. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that the prevention of injuries during strength-based RT programs has been clinically addressed at length in the sports field and less from the perspective of fitness in PFC, which warrants further research. In any case, “no pain, no gain” should not be a training maxim, as highlighted by Ritsch (2020) [ 61 ]. The key to the prevention of injuries in recreational weightlifters and bodybuilders is having professional supervision and adhering to proper lifting techniques and training habits that might positively impact the allostatic load and exercise-induced adaptations.",0.6705077374276074,0.6705077374276074,0.013097187798893606,0.013097187798893606,0.26204595717159485,0.26204595717159485,0.24703702362265018,0.24703702362265018,0.45750310148405227,0.37997397321164755,0.39575568111527976,0.3695124648952004,0.3891948770602599,4
PMC10856087,Current Evidence Regarding Shoulder Instability in the Paediatric and Adolescent Population.,2024,"Paediatric and adolescent shoulder instability is caused by a unique combination of traumatic factors, ligamentous laxity, and pattern of muscle contractility. The multifactorial nature of its aetiology makes interpretation of the literature difficult as nomenclature is also highly variable. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing literature and shed light on the nuances of paediatric and adolescent shoulder instability. The epidemiology, clinical features, imaging, and management of all forms of paediatric shoulder instability are presented. The main findings of this review are that structural abnormalities following a dislocation are uncommon in pre-pubertal paediatric patients. Young post-pubertal adolescents are at the highest risk of failure of non-operative management in the setting of traumatic instability with structural abnormality, and early stabilisation should be considered for these patients. Remplissage and the Latarjet procedure are safe treatment options for adolescents at high risk of recurrence, but the side-effect profile should be carefully considered. Patients who suffer from instability due to generalized ligamentous laxity benefit from a structured, long-term physiotherapy regimen, with surgery in the form of arthroscopic plication as a viable last resort. Those who suffer from a predominantly muscle patterning pathology do not benefit from surgery and require focus on regaining neuromuscular control. 9. Conclusions Paediatric and adolescent shoulder instability is a complex and clinically challenging area. It straddles a grey zone between several types of shoulder instability. In the younger child, shoulder instability without structural abnormalities predominates. Whereas in the older adolescent, the pathology is more likely to reflect that seen in adults, with structural injuries such as HSLs and Bankart lesions. Ligamentous laxity and muscle patterning abnormalities are more likely to exist in the younger patient, adding to the diagnostic challenges. For traumatic instability with structural lesions, adolescents are at a very high risk of poor outcomes with non-operative management, and stabilisation should be considered early with consideration given to adjuncts such as remplissage based on the characteristics of bone loss. The Latarjet is a viable option for adolescents and can be used in cases of failed arthroscopic treatment or for high-risk patients, but the side-effect profile should be carefully considered. For MDI, the mainstay of treatment remains specialist long-term and regular physiotherapy with arthroscopic plication as the preferred option if conservative means fail. Finally, for shoulder instability arising from predominant muscle patterning problems, the focus should be on gaining neuromuscular control, with the promise of newer technology such as the shoulder pacemaker to augment rehabilitation programs.",0.7013484338794376,0.7013484338794376,0.20429754457491703,0.20429754457491703,0.5508106685228453,0.5508106685228453,0.6195892726843975,0.6195892726843975,0.7278854362260313,0.619908392229965,0.5979666372955584,0.5605893201447087,0.588622308007846,4
PMC9159717,Rehabilitation After Surgical Treatment of Pectoralis Major Rupture in a CrossFit® Practitioner: A Case Report.,2022,"Background and Purpose The upper limbs are frequently injured during CrossFit® practice, and in some cases, surgical repair is recommended. The purpose of this case report was to describe the rehabilitation process performed after the surgical repair of a pectoralis major rupture in a CrossFit® practitioner. Design Case report. Case Description The subject was a 26-year-old man, with 1.75m and 69kg, who practiced CrossFit® for five years and sustained the injury during the execution of the ring dip. The rehabilitation protocol was of 16 weeks duration. Passive modalities and exercises focusing on range of motion, muscle strength, and CrossFit®-specific movements were performed. Shoulder range of motion was assessed through goniometry, and muscle strength was assessed through isometric dynamometry. Outcomes At week seven the subject had full range of motion, and at week fourteen achieved limb symmetry (Limb Symmetry Index - 84.78 – Abduction; 97.58 – Adduction; 86.15 – Internal Rotation; 85.06 – External Rotation) in muscle strength. The subject returned to his previous level of athletic activities. Conclusions: A 16-week protocol performed with exercises focusing on range of motion, muscle strength, and CrossFit®-specific movements was abe to promote the return to sport at the pre-injury level in a CrossFit® practitioner. Conclusion The results of this case report indicate that a Crossfit ® practitioner can be successfully returned to sport after surgical repair of the pectoralis major. While isolated injuries of the pectoralis major have a rare occurrence in Crossfit ® practitioners, the results of this case report indicate that a protocol focused on range of motion, muscle strength, and sports-specific movements is effective to promote the return to athletic activities.
